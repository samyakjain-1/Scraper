I thought that the workload was not too much to handle. Some projects could be difficult and office hours would be busy during then. \n\nSTAT240 was not too bad either. It was a lot of practice getting to know R in the first half of the semester then moved to statistics the second half. The class was not too difficult. CS320 was my favorite though, STATS was just less interesting"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/18a6rls/cs_320_and_stat_240/"}
