Doing all the homework and participation, along with whatever percent you got on your quizzes, should get you a passing grade even if you get a 0% on the final", "I got a 68% in the class last semester and that was a B. Obviously it will vary by semester but you'll be fine.", "Out of curiosity has anyone ever heard of someone getting a 50 on the exam?"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/136rzsg/cs_577_grade_distribution/"}
