{"title": "CS 540 Intro to AI", "body": "The professor just explained at the end of the lecture how 540 will be building on the foundations of linear algebra and topics like linear algebra, matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication, what it means to have a reverse matrix, etc. I have no knowledge of any linear algebra and I don't know much Python. Can I still do well in the class (can I get an A) with the current knowledge I have or will it be too difficult? Thanks", "comments": ["I have taken CS540 and Linesr Algebra should almost be a prerequisite. You\u2019ll use matrices a fair bit, but not to the full depth of Linear Algebra. I\u2019d watch some videos to get a good grasp of it", "I would suggest starting with 3blue1brown videos. I haven't taken CS540 yet but when I took linear algebra it was a great way to get my basics right and improve my understanding."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/16dtgsy/cs_540_intro_to_ai/"}
