{"title": "CS 537 (OS) Midterm Tips?", "body": "The exam is on Wednesday and I am super nervous, would really appreciate some tips on studying for it from people who have taken it with Remzi before!", "comments": ["I got you, although these are largely general exam tips:\n\nThe exam is very long. Do the practice exams and time yourself. If you don't know something star it and keep going.\n\nThe multiple choice/ true or false questions are almost always from lecture slides. By reviewing previous slides and doing practice exams you should definitely cover enough material to get >80% of them.\n\nShort response questions require knowing the content from discussions well. I am assuming you are studying virtualization, when I took that exam it had questions that were almost identical to the questions we solved in discussion. Your best bet is to review the problem from these discussions with an emphasis on understanding it conceptually (understanding what you are given, what you are being asked to produce, what steps are needed to get there). From your previous time studying practice exams, you should be able to deduce what some of the short answers will look like. During the exam do the ones that look the most familiar first, and leave questions that look unique last.\n\nYou really don't need a 100% on each exam. I think I averaged an 80-85% on each exam, got all points on projects, and finished with an A. It's doable but remember it's a hard class and getting an A isn't essential for graduation! You got this.\n\nGL!", "his textbook is goated memorize that"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/y51gye/cs_537_os_midterm_tips/"}
