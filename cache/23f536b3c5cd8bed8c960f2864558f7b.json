I am not here to give you my opinion, rather I want you to assess for yourself. This is a hefty class, and it is worth researching whether you want to take it or not.\n\nI have compiled a bunch of Remzi's lectures so far for you to watch. imo these are some of the best lectures on campus and I really enjoy them.\n\nFurther, there is a link to projects on the bottom. Please look through the readme files on these projects. These will take up your weekends easily (I spent about 38 hours on the project due 2 days ago, and it wasn't even the hardest project.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TcypnhvnGILCWb0F-N9xpU2OdqMzbyPr3v7nlytRe80/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TcypnhvnGILCWb0F-N9xpU2OdqMzbyPr3v7nlytRe80/edit)\n\nHere is a link to the official class (there is no canvas page, all the course material is on this website and on piazza):\n\n[https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/\\~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2022/](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2022/)\n\nHere are project solutions ( the description of each project is found in the link above)\n\n[https://github.com/devang-m/CS537](https://github.com/devang-m/CS537)\n\nWhether you're studying for exams, or just thinking about taking OS or developing interest in it, I highly recommend watching lectures.
