", "comments": ["My thoughts on the major AI/ML classes:\n\nCS 540(Have not taken): A lot more programming based, from what I\u2019ve heard 70% of ur grade is programming projects. The math usually shows up on ur exams, and it\u2019s not super hardcore Lin alg. Overall if u know how to code and have decent math then you should be fine\n\nCS 539(I took this): The hardcore Lin alg and multi which goes on in Neural Networks. You learn the math behind different types on NN, although the basis of all is the same. Exams are mix of conceptual and math, but the conceptual leans in the mathy side rather than given a random scenario. You also cover other ml topics like tree models for like a week before moving in to neural networks. You have in class exercises and hw, which are mix of math and programming.\n\nCS 532(Have not taken): The math behind a lot of ML methods. So more hard core lin alg like PCA and SVD because a lot of ML relies on these. At the end it\u2019s more like how how these are lin alg techniques are used in models you know today. The programming consists of programming the topics u learned of. \n\nThe ones I have not taken are things I\u2019ve heard for friends.", "if you get calculus and linear algebra, 540 will be easy. 539 is not needed for 540 at all.", "I took CS540. If you want to go deep in ML then I would not recommend this class as they teach everything at a very shallow level. They don't dive deep into the topics they teach. The projects are mostly easy as well, and you don't learn that much from them. If doing ML is what you wanted in the future I personally think 539 and 532 are better. If you are into deep learning, I highly recommend cs 639 deep learning for cv."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1dl5kt3/cs_540_vs_539/"}
