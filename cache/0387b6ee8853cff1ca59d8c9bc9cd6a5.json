{"title": "Math 221 or Math 222 for incoming freshmen?", "body": "I will be starting at UWMadison in the fall as a freshmen. For context, I am looking to major in comp sci or may later pursue something in the school of business depending on how my first comp sci class goes. \nMy placement scores enable me to take Math 221 but my advisor told me that if I get a 4 or 5 on my AP Calc AB exam then I could take Math 222 instead. I received a 4 so now I have to decide if I should take Math 222 or stay with Math 221. \nDoes AP Calc AB provide a strong enough foundation to start Math 222 as a freshmen? Is it recommended to take Math 222 now? My initial reaction is to take Math 222 but want to see what other people think.\n\nWould appreciate any advice. Thanks.", "comments": ["I'd recommend taking 222. If you really want a refresher, watch some Khan Academy vids on calc. 222 has a little bit of review at the beginning as well I believe.", "Our math department isn\u2019t amazing here and a lot of people struggle in 221 and 222. So I would just try to get it over with as soon as possible.", "i was in the same situation! i took 222 and struggled for most of the semester, but i ultimately got a B and am glad i didn\u2019t take 221. i didn\u2019t feel that i learned well from my prof and had to put in a lot of extra work practicing the content, but you\u2019ll probably be fine if you\u2019re willing to work for it. :)"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/vw156g/math_221_or_math_222_for_incoming_freshmen/"}
