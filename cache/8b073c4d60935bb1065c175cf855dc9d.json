But don\u2019t worry we still have 2 exams to come and probably she is going to curve it.  and Btw were we supposed to write it with honor lock?? I just checked midterm 1 information and there were not a word about honor lock, but apparently, the syllabus says that we should have turned it on. PLEASE TELL ME ANYBODY IS IT JUST ME or she cancelled it.", "Yeah so I just took it and....yikes. \n\nChecked my work 5 times for each question but still got a 76% as well. Big throw. \n\nI\u2019d be stunned if there\u2019s a curve, but I think we will probably get a B with our grade."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/j9w9yh/econ_102_exam_with_chan/"}
