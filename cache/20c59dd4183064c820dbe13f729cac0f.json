I\u2019ve heard lots of people on this sub say it\u2019s so excruciating and difficult and was just wondering if it is really as hard as people make it seem. Will I still be able to succeed and have a social scene?", "comments": ["It\u2019s infamously tough but as long as you take the needed time to do the work (homework and studying) you can still have a social life. Just don\u2019t procrastinate or miss easy points on assignments/quizzes.", "222 is brutal, yeah. It\u2019s doable if you study for it consistently and go to TA office hours when you get confused. You can\u2019t cram for it", "I think it has that reputation because it's the first college level math class that people take after high school. If you went to an easier high school, then yeah, it's going to feel like an arctic plunge going from high school math to UW fend for yourself Math. But it's an intro course and hundreds of students take it every semester and nearly everyone passes it. It's hard but doable."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1f8ehc6/is_math_222_really_that_hard/"}
