I wished I had followed my friend\u2019s advice: \u201cstop going to lecture, and just deep read the textbook\u201d. \n\nStill go to lecture, but you only need to take notes on the Latin phrases and blue box material. When that comes up, immediately take a picture of it and jot it down. \n\nI would not recommend to paying attention to the rest of the lecture material because most of the facts and figures he presents are not revised nor accurate with actual, up-to-date figures. \n\nLook at old practice exams and do all the textbook prep material. \n\nI went to every lecture and while I got points for all the Latin phrases and some of the blue box material, but I didn\u2019t do much textbook prep. As a result, I ended with a BC. \n\nYou got this! Take a deep breathe. Get some coffee, tea, or something that makes you feel good, and when you are ready, read that darn textbook! You\u2019ll do great!", "basically study the latin terms and the textbook the exam will not cover anything abt Harvey Davidson motorcycles( i hope u get this)", "Can confirm like what the others said. I took his class back in 2019, what he talks is mostly unrelated to what the exams gonna be. He explains okayish but to do well in the exams you gotta do cengage practices (not sure if that's still a thing) but going through the textbook helps alot. I take my own notes. I spend like a good amount studying (2/3 hours daily) and got B (i was 1 point away from AB dangit). \n\nIn hindsight, i dont think the class is that hard but I wasn't doing that many practises to familiarize myself well with the concepts. Never went to Rick's office hours but I did went to the TA's OH which really helped."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/16xngrv/how_to_study_for_econ_102_midterm_with_steven_rick/"}
