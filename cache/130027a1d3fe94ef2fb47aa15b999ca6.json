I have no programming experience but I have started to learn python on my own. I am worried i am in over my head with that class and math 221. Am I cooked?", "comments": ["200 and 220 are designed for students with no CS background. Chill out.", "It\u2019s an intro class and they will teach you everything from scratch. You will be fine.\n\nAlso you are a DS major, it\u2019s a lot different from a cs one.", "My business major roommate took CS 220 last year because he thought it would be an interesting course to fill his science requirement. He got below a 25% on a multiple choice exam with only 4 answers per question (so, statistically, he did worse than if he would have guessed). As a Computer Engineer who feels that business kids have if way too easy, I found this hilarious. Despite this, he was still able to pass the class with either a B or C. If you put in the work and avoid the temptation of ChatGPT (because you don\u2019t learn anything when AI is writing the code for you), you\u2019ll do great! There will be times when you spend way too long debugging code just for you to realize one line was slightly incorrect (thus destroying your entire program). That\u2019s ok! Taking the time to debug/fix your code properly will make you a far better coder and will give you a heightened  understanding of how computers interpret code. Good luck!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1e83bro/comp_sci_220_with_no_programming_experience/"}
