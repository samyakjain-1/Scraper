{"title": "How is Econ 102 with Steven Rick", "body": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of mixed reviews on RateMyProfessor saying that the Steven Rick is bad at teaching, but some say the overall class is pretty easy. So due to this, I\u2019m still kinda in the dark in regards to what I can expect from the class.\n\nIf anyone has taken this class and can provide any insight about the content of the class or the professor, I\u2019d greatly appreciate it!", "comments": ["[deleted]", "Had him for Econ 102 last semester and honestly it was really hard to focus on the material because he's just not an engaging prof at all.  Every lecture was a Powerpoint with graphs and charts that had little overlap with the textbook but was mostly just \"real-world\" examples, plus the Latin terms and Blue Boxes you need to take note of because that was the only lecture material present on exams.  \n\nThat said, it wasn't a difficult course by any means and studying for exams was really easy since most exam content came from the textbook which had a lot of practice questions available.  You'll learn as much as the work you put into the class, but if you're not an econ major this is not the class that's gonna convert you (saying this as an econ major).", "I love him he's an icon. Definitely bored me to sleep multiple times but that's because i took the class at 8 am. Overall I think macro is just easier than micro, so I did very well in 102"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/i8pla3/how_is_econ_102_with_steven_rick/"}
