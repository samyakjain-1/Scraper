My professor writes things on the board and then never goes over the complicated stuff as a problem only as a concept. Then it ends up being on an exam as a problem.\n\nDiscussions are at this point useless. I've been working alone the whole time and I have so many questions I feel bad to ask the TA.\n\nI go to tutoring atleast 2 times a week for an hour each time just for one on one. I work backwards from chegg and am brain fogged to high hell.\n\nI just want a C man. I'll retake the class if I have to, but I want to atleast have a chance to pass on the first try without getting a D.", "comments": ["Paul\u2019s online math notes. Best resource there is", "Most of it is modeled from the online Cengage book in my experience. All the lectures I attended for 222 just went over the same problems the book uses to teach", "Don\u2019t feel bad to ask the TA, that\u2019s literally their job. In discussion definitely limit so that you aren\u2019t taking away from the learning of other students but go to office hours for professor and TA and they will help you and you can go in depth with what you don\u2019t understand"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/tacqz9/please_link_resources_to_teach_myself_math_222/"}
