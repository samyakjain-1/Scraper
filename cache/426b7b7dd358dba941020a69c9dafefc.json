I decided I want to major in computer science. Im scared though because I have no experience coding. Im trying to start to prepare, and Im reading Starting out with Java by Tony Gladdis. But I feel like its not good enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need a win. I need and want to do well in this class. What can I do to better prepare?", "comments": ["Probably start coding little projects in Eclipse by yourself. CS 200 is supposed to start out geared towards people who have not coded before, so if you're able to get comfortable with basic syntax, semantic, and just the normal steps a java programmer goes through to make an application, you will have an edge.\n\nFor example, you can code a fun text program, a fibonacci sequence generator, a perfect number generator, etc. etc., and finally, use a loop and out of these sub-projects, make one big project whose functions the user can choose from. I've found doing stuff like that to be beneficial for getting into the groove of coding.", "i went into the class with 0 programming experience and did well, you\u2019ll be fine!! tips i can give you to do well once the class starts are to stay on top of stuff(actually pay attention to weekly zybooks) & start your programs early. TA office hours are a lifesaver, but go early in the week when a big program is due because they get insanely busy", "Don\u2019t worry about 200 dude.
