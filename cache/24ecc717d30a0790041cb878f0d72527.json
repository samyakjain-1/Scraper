I wouldn't do anything more though, my first semester I took 13 credits just to get used to university life first. CS 200 and Math 221 are going to be your hardest classes I think. You can drop courses within the first three weeks I think so if it gets to be too much I think that could be an option for LSC 100 or Econ 100.", "Go with HEPLER! (you won't regret it)", "I know 15 credits is considered the average and maybe even the recommended amount, but I would honestly drop a class. 5 classes as a freshman sounds like a lot.\n\nEdit: nvm"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/o1sqf5/how_is_my_schedule_for_my_first_semester/"}
