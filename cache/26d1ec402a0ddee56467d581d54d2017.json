{"title": "How much review does CS320 do before diving into the hard stuff?", "body": "I took CS301 two years ago, which is basically CS220 now as I understand it. I got an 'A' and didn't think it was too difficult, but I haven't really touched python since. \n\nI'm not a CS major, but 320 sounds interesting, so I signed up for the Fall. I'm wondering how much self-studying I will have to do (if any) this summer before starting?", "comments": ["Hello, is CS 320 an extension of CS 319? Also, how difficult will this course be for a non-CS (ECE) major?", "There's not much, I did 220 and 320 back to back but it felt like it wasn't bad and what I would run in to was I'd just end up googling stuff that I forgot lol"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/nkvqiv/how_much_review_does_cs320_do_before_diving_into/"}
