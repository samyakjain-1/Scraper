{"title": "comp sci 200", "body": "Is it worth taking Comp Sci 200 next semester or rather take it over the summer?\n\nI\u2019m currently planning to take Math 221, Chem 104, and English 100. I\u2019m considering Biomedical Engineering as a major (not for sure) and their recommended 4-year plan had Comp Sci 200 as a class to take. \n\nI\u2019m also have some interests in computer science, and wanted to explore that a bit (I have no prior knowledge on coding). I read reviews on RateMyProfessors and saw a lot of negative reviews on Jim Williams and got a bit worried about that.", "comments": ["I've had a couple awful professors (shoutout to Laurentiu Maxim) and Jim is nowhere near that list. I took it with 0 programming experience and I'd say it was pretty average in terms of difficulty. It's not going to be the best class you take here by a long shot, but people on RMP are being way too dramatic with his reviews.", "comp sci 200 is definitely a challenging class to take with no to minimal prior coding experience. i have professor williams in his online lecture. he isn't a bad professor but the lectures for that class are quite pointless. i wouldn't recommend taking the class over the summer as it will be very heavy workload especially at the accelerated rate. if you are interested in cs then 200 is the class to take but if you are looking for an easier class i have heard 220 is easier, but i'm not sure if that will fulfills your requirements.", "I took it this semester with Williams and, having no prior CS knowledge, I found it to be one of the easiest courses I've ever had. That said, in retrospect, I feel like pretty much everything we covered is easily accessible via free online coding bootcamps, so I wish I had considered that option a bit more beforehand."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/r1h0sz/comp_sci_200/"}
