The class has very little reading material available.", "comments": ["All completed notebook files and readings are linked on the course website\n\nhttps://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f22/schedule.html", "Not much reading is actually done in the course, it\u2019s mostly project and practice based", "Like the others said, the only real reference materials are the slides and completed notebooks. Other than that I would definitely recommend checking out the old exams (linked on the course website) for what you can expect.\n\nFor studying: try taking one of the old exams. Once you're done, take a look at the answer key and make note of what concepts/units you are struggling with. Then, go back and focus on reviewing those sections. Ask questions on piazza if you're still struggling with material. If you're still struggling, send me a message and I'll try to help if I can"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/zm96tm/compsci_220_notes/"}
