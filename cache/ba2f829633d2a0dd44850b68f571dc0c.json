{"title": "CS537 Grade curve?", "body": "I am suffering from major depression, especially for the past half of this semester. As a result, I did poorly on one project and midterm 1, scoring just one point above the lower quartile. The rest received full points. I am now worried about my final grade because I want to take Advanced OS next semester. Even consider taking OS as my focus of future career or academic life. OS is really interesting to me. Can anyone share their experience with grading? Is is possible to get an A? I am in Michael Swift's section. Any ideas would be appreciated.", "comments": ["i wouldn't worry too much about grading - they're pretty generous with the curve. i think an 80 was an A last sem but i don't remember the specifics", "How can you tell you were in the in the lower quartile? I didn't see any statistics for the midterm 1 published.\n\nI got a low score in the exam and am also seriously disappointed. It's demoralizing to be clobbered with an intentionally impossible exam. I submit that no good-willed professor would subject students to such humiliating tactics. It's sadism. They want us to feel inferior and inadequate. They want to feel that they can do whatever they wish with grades, and to assert their control and superiority. That's the real motivation behind \"grade curves\".\n\nAfter realizing that, one should be determined not to let their dirty tactics ruin your motivation. Fight back. Keep learning and don't let them drag you down. In less than two months those power lusters will be only an unpleasant memory. Keep up your enthusiasm and your plans for the future. Don't let mean people upset your balance, much less ruin your future!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/11xpyzo/cs537_grade_curve/"}
