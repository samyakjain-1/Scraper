I\u2019ve had decent workloads before so I\u2019m confident of my capacity but still, is it chill if I organize myself well enough?", "comments": ["537 is HEAVILY project based and often they take much longer than you expect, TA office hours are pretty much mandatory for some of the projects. Your schedule is definitely manageable as long as you start early on projects so they don\u2019t sneak up on you.", "hopefully those are your only stem classes \ud83d\udc80 i took 340 and 540 last fall and it woulda been fine but i also took discrete and 353 and accounting", "If 537 is OS(unsure and don\u2019t feel like looking it up) that class is honestly closer to a 6+ credit class with the amount of work you have to put into projects. So make sure most of your other claaaes don\u2019t have a lot of work"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/195vi6g/stat_340_cs_537_and_cs_540/"}
