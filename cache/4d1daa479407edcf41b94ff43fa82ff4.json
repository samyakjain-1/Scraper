{"title": "Calculus Credit exam (Math 222)", "body": "I am going to take the calculus credit exam for math 222 this fall semester. However, I am confused about how the credit of the test counts. For example, Would I just have to take 116 credits for the bachelor if I pass the credit exam or I still have to do 120. If I pass the credit but with low percentage(80%), what letter grade I will have. Thanks!", "comments": ["You will get 4 credits for MATH 222 if you pass the credit exam. Your transcript will show a \"T\" and will not count toward your GPA (i.e. no letter grade like A or B will be awarded).", "I am a bit confused when reading this: https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-1005.", "I think the credit exam allows you to skip Math 222 and go to Math 234. You would just have to do the remaining credits."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1f5sw2c/calculus_credit_exam_math_222/"}
