Also I need 3 credits of bio sciences", "comments": ["CS degree planner recommends taking an elective with 537, and I agree. I personally took CS 559, it\u2019s computer graphics. I loved the class. Honestly might be the best class I\u2019ve taken at UW. 537 is very project heavy, so you will be spending a lot of time doing work with a group. I would recommend just looking at all the offered CS classes that count as electives and just pick the one that sounds the best to you. CS 579 is also great, but hard to get into. 540 is another class I enjoyed, intro to AI."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/u06vbe/cs_course_to_take_with_cs537/"}
