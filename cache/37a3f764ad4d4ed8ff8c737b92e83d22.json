{"title": "cs 220 workload", "body": "for anyone who has taken the class before, how much time will I be spending on the work/projects outside of class each week? thanks!", "comments": ["[removed]", "It could be a shit ton. I had no coding experience and spent at least 5+ hours on average on each project with a partner. Office hour lines are long, but useful. Buckle up and good luck", "I had no cs experience so the first few projects probably took me 10 hours to do. But once you get into the swing of things and find a project partner it could be closer to 3 hours a person. It also depends on office hours as trying to get help added a lot of time as the wait time was always at least an hour"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/10i7f9d/cs_220_workload/"}
