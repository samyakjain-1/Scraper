I do not want to get myself into something I will regret, and was hoping the class would be easier as opposed to taking it with other classes during the school year. Thoughts, advice, or past experience would be appreciated!", "comments": ["I had her for 101 a few years ago. Not as math heavy as other professors I've heard about. Plus she's a babe. Shwing!", "100 level econ courses with Eudey are great, and so easy. I had her for 102 in Fall 2013. She assigned very little homework, her lectures were clear and well-explained, and exams were non-cumulative (and incredibly easy). I spent maybe 1-2 hours studying per test. I highly recommend her for 100 level classes, however I don't know if taking an online course with her will be different or not. Based off my experience, I would suggest just taking it during a regular school semester. The class doesn't add that huge of a work load onto your schedule, unless you already foresee yourself being at the tipping point (18 credits + job etc) then consider doing it online. But either way, I think you'll be fine and get a good grade as long as you take notes during lecture and do the homework", "Go to (or...watch? If it's online?) her exam reviews she is very clear about what she will test you on, not tricky at all! She also tends to pull a lot from her practice exams (homework too) so study those if she makes them available!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/5wxuy7/has_anyone_taken_econ102_online_in_summer_w_gwen/"}
