{"title": "CS 577 Honors", "body": "Has anyone taken CS 577 Honors with Dieter? If so, what was it like and is it worth it over the regular class?", "comments": ["it probably hurts for the amount of effort you'll have to exert for the material and staying on top of it, but you're gonna learn as much as you put in for the class. Dieter knows his stuff, and he also coaches the ACM competitive team. If you put in a lot of effort, you will learn a bunch in the process. I would assume the honors class would gear you more towards the ACM style competitive coding problems, and probably push the patterns on how to solve types of problems. If you decide to take it, good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee lecture notes and assignments from when Dieter taught it with Honors in 2011:\n\n[http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/\\~dieter/Courses/2011s-CS577/assignments.html](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dieter/Courses/2011s-CS577/assignments.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso see the same question asked:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/mtj54h/cs\\_577\\_accelerated\\_honors\\_with\\_dieter/", "Not worth extra hurdle unless you are gonna go into CS Theory graduate school, or at the very least you are interested in actually knowing algorithms in and out rather than just being able to implement them on a computer."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/nlq04z/cs_577_honors/"}
