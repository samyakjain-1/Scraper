This is coming from someone who hated Econ 101 and is struggling with online classes a bit in general. There\u2019s also no Honorlock (we have open note/book exams) so that\u2019s pretty great.", "Johnson is entertaining and likes to curve.

Try to take it with Chan because her transition to online was fantastic and I honestly stopped reading the textbooks after 1st exam and just watched the lectures. Anyways, if you found 101 interesting and not extremely challenging, I am sure that you will love 102 as well", "Most people here found 102 easier.

I found Econ 101 much easier, but I found both clases very interesting and relatively simple. \n\nFor context I got an AB on both classes."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/kivz42/difficulty_of_econ_102/"}, {"title": "how to study for econ 102 midterm with steven rick", "body": "someone please help me on how to study for his exam. the notes i take in lecture are EXTREMELY UNRELATED to the textbook material. he hardly lectures on textbook related things. with all his blue box facts and random latin phrases, what do i actually study? how do i actually study for this exam in general?", "comments": ["I wish I could say that this is not normal but this was exactly my experience with him last semester. I wished I had followed my friend\u2019s advice: \u201cstop going to lecture, and just deep read the textbook\u201d. \n\nStill go to lecture, but you only need to take notes on the Latin phrases and blue box material. When that comes up, immediately take a picture of it and jot it down. \n\nI would not recommend to paying attention to the rest of the lecture material because most of the facts and figures he presents are not revised nor accurate with actual, up-to-date figures. \n\nLook at old practice exams and do all the textbook prep material. \n\nI went to every lecture and while I got points for all the Latin phrases and some of the blue box material, but I didn\u2019t do much textbook prep. As a result, I ended with a BC. \n\nYou got this! Take a deep breathe. Get some coffee, tea, or something that makes you feel good, and when you are ready, read that darn textbook! You\u2019ll do great!", "basically study the latin terms and the textbook the exam will not cover anything abt Harvey Davidson motorcycles( i hope u get this)", "Can confirm like what the others said. I took his class back in 2019, what he talks is mostly unrelated to what the exams gonna be. He explains okayish but to do well in the exams you gotta do cengage practices (not sure if that's still a thing) but going through the textbook helps alot. I take my own notes. I spend like a good amount studying (2/3 hours daily) and got B (i was 1 point away from AB dangit). \n\nIn hindsight, i dont think the class is that hard but I wasn't doing that many practises to familiarize myself well with the concepts. Never went to Rick's office hours but I did went to the TA's OH which really helped."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/16xngrv/how_to_study_for_econ_102_midterm_with_steven_rick/"}, {"title": "Econ 102 Grade...How doomed am I?", "body": "Okay, Okay, So,\n\nI am a sophomore in Econ102 with Stella Chan and recently got back my second midterm...and I got a pretty bad grade.

I personally liked and respected the guy a lot. He genuinely enjoys teaching and he will teach you based current day real world examples which is rlly cool if u like economics. \n\nNow onto the course itself. 50% of the content is what I like to call \u201creal world economics\u201d (this is the stuff from his lectures) and 50% is from the textbook.\n\nYou gotta read the textbook. All the homework will be only on the textbook readings. It\u2019s kinda tedious but as long as you read closely and understand the material, the homework isn\u2019t that bad. I personally took notes on the textbook but I know a lot of ppl just read it and did fine. \n\nThe exams are also pretty doable. The main lecture content is stuff from the blue boxes. The blue boxes are the most important stuff from the lecture but I will say that you should still pay attention to the rest of the lecture too. \nThe rest of the exam content is easy stuff from the textbook. The types of homework question will always be harder than the exam questions.
