{"title": "CS 200?", "body": "Hello, I am taking COMS 200 for this spring and it is an online course due to a pandemic. \n\nSo far, I just feel like it is really easy than I expect. because at first, I thought programming class would be super hard and heard many people complaining about CS courses. (I have 0 experience with coding before taking this one)\n\nNow, I am just wondering whether it is easy because it is just an online course?\n\nI mean the workload is pretty a lot and zylabs are still challengeing, but like the tests are pretty easy compares to other exams. \n\nAnyone who took this course as in-person?", "comments": ["I took it in person and it was really hard at first. I went it with zero programming experience too. I ended up studying a lot and doing well by the end of the semester. \n\nCS can be different for everyone, regardless of experience. Not only do you have to remember programming syntax but its also accompanied by a \\*new\\* way of logically thinking (for lack of better words). Some people get a grasp on both of them faster than others, and either way its fine. From what I've seen as a peer tutor, CS200 still covers everything that it did before. You'll be fine.", "Basic CS courses are just some basic logic with some programming so it should not be hard. And CS 200 is a introductory course which many people skipped by AP or something."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/m7t08g/cs_200/"}
