{"title": "CS 544 or 564", "body": "Looking for which one will prepare me more for a career in software engineering. I need one more requirement for SW and HW. Currently in OS and enjoying it.", "comments": ["Take both! The combined workload I think would be comparable to OS on its own. 564 had a restructure and is now a lot easier. There will be some direct overlap with the SQL stuff but both will be in the same vain and prepare you extremely well for your career.", "I\u2019ve taken both and I think 544 honestly would get you more job ready. That class goes over stuff like using Docker, provisioning VMs on a public cloud, learning how NoSQL databases work. The bare minimum you need to know about relational databases is how to query (select, from, join, where) and they even cover that in 544. Of course, there\u2019s a lot more to relational databases than that, and hence I\u2019d consider 564 a foundational class that you *should* take at some point. But if you just care about \u201cjob ready\u201d skills, I\u2019d recommend 544.", "If you looking for a course that will prepare for a career that will definitely be 564, where you will learn about database architecture, sql, optimization, and b+ tree. Whereas 544, it\u2019s more towards data engineering, distribution systems technologies"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/17sgui7/cs_544_or_564/"}
