{"title": "CS320 vs CS220", "body": "I am a computer science major currently taking CS300 and want to get introduced to Data Science (to see if I want to double major in it) but have very minimal experience with Python. Since I can skip CS220 to take CS320, which recommends experience with Python, should I take 320? Is 320 difficult if I have to initially learn Python?\n\nAlso, if I do take 320, would it be difficult to take 400 and 252 at the same time along with 1 or 2 gen eds?\n\n  \nLast thing: should I even take either CS220 or 320 to get introduced to DS, or should I take Stat240 to do so?", "comments": ["CS student not very familiar with python in the middle of 320 here.\n\nI didn\u2019t know too much python and I\u2019m doing fine, only thing is projects take a while sometimes and as a result I wouldn\u2019t recommend all three of 252/320/400. Pick and choose two. \n\nTaking 320 is fine, as long as you know your principles and can catch up on concepts beforehand. Or just ask google or stack overflow", "I\u2019m in 220 rn and I had no experience with Python and I will say that it does take a good chunk of time every week, it\u2019s decently easy to learn and a good intro to python"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gw7m66/cs320_vs_cs220/"}
