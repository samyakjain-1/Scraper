{"title": "How to choose two AI/ML courses from CS540, CS532, CS539", "body": "Any recommendation combo? I hope the pressure is not too much because there is still CS577", "comments": ["I took 540 last semester and am currently taking 532. From my experience, 540 is more programming-heavy, while 532 is more math-heavy. 540 will teach more practical stuff in AI/ML, while 532 will provide you with more theoretical foundation.\n\nIf you are serious about AI/ML, you might want to take 532. If you just want to use AI/ML, you might want to take 540. Although I guess people sometimes do both.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, I personally think 540 is much easier than 532. In 532, you will have 2 short quizzes/week, 1  assignment every 1-2 week, and 5 unit tests. 540 only has weekly programming assignments and 2 exams.\n\nThere is another course: CS/ECE 561, which is also a theoretical/math-oriented ML course that can be taken after 532. This one is more about probability.", "Oh I just posted a comment about my exp in 539 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/tv1f9i/has_anyone_here_taken_cs_524_cs_525_or_cs_539/i3ajqkh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) (-:", "540 goes through concepts of linear algebra and ml very fast\n\ni took 532 first and im taking 540 this semester, highly recommend taking 532 first and then taking 540 later is optional\n\n539 goes in depth into the last topic taught in 532 and should probably also be taken after 532"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/tu0snq/how_to_choose_two_aiml_courses_from_cs540_cs532/"}
