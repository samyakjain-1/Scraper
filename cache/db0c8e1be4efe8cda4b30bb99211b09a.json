{"title": "Math 222?", "body": "Taking Math 222 next sem. Does anyone have the syllabus with them? How can I prepare for 222 this summer? I've heard 222 is very time-intensive (as expected of Calc 2) so getting a few concepts clear prior to the semester will help.\n\nThanks in advance!", "comments": ["Sacrifice a goat and a rooster every morning at sunbreak.  It's probably as useful as any other preparation you can do for that course.", "There's honestly not much you can do to prepare for 222. 221 is completely different IMO, so other than knowing how to do more advanced integrals/memorizing trig integrals and shortcuts, there's not much I can think of to prepare. 222 is basically: Learn simple concepts and manipulations, then somehow figure out how to remember and use all of these concepts to manipulate situations you've never encountered before. It also depends on what Prof you have. I had Noah (Schweiber?), but I heard that it wasn't as difficult with other professors.", "The thing with all these posts about getting ahead in classes is that it's more about not getting behind once school actually starts. It's good that you want info ahead of time but the course is very manageable if you give it the time it deserves during the year rather than wasting time like many (myself included) fall victim to."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/c7te73/math_222/"}
