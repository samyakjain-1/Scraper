{"title": "CS 200 Lecture smell", "body": "I'm so infuriated with the recurring issue of body odor in the computer science lecture room. It's high time we challenge this stereotype that associates poor personal hygiene with those in the tech field. We're in the 21st century, surrounded by innovation, yet some individuals can't grasp the concept of using soap and water. This perpetuates a damaging image of computer scientists as socially inept or careless. We need to break free from these outdated misconceptions and demand a workspace where everyone respects basic personal grooming. Let's rise above this stereotype and show the world that competence and cleanliness are not mutually exclusive!\n\nGenerated by chatGPT because I need a compelling message.", "comments": ["Holy fuck \ud83d\udc80 im not a cs major and i thought it was all a joke but its real", "Nah bro, showering is unlocked in cs300", "This is not the first time a post like this has been made. At this point it's tradition that CS freshmen will never shower for the whole first year."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/16sejfb/cs_200_lecture_smell/"}
