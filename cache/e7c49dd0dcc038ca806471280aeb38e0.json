With 2 CS courses already, best to be careful.", "You could just enroll in some gen ed and swap with the course you end up getting i.e. put yourself on both wait-lists. However, do keep the drop deadlines in mind:\nhttps://registrar.wisc.edu/dates/", "577 is structured more around exams whereas 540 is structured around projects. Given that 354 is more project oriented, it fits better to have an exam centered course like 577. However, scheduling conflicts are always a pain to deal with. You can use your judgement there. 577 also fills the theory requirement for CS.\n\nI assume you are taking other courses aside from these 3, and if so, this will be a lot of work (maybe too much). If it's just these 3, it will definitely be manageable."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/10irqsb/cs_540_cs_577/"}
