{"title": "CS 220 Partners", "body": "I am VERY confused on the logistics for working with a partner on the CS projects. I\u2019m tempted to work alone because I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d even work collaboratively on something like this. People who have taken CS 220, what was your experience like with you partner? Would working alone be doable?", "comments": ["Work with a partner. So much better than working alone. You can find a partner in your lab or through Piazza", "Can\u2019t say for sure but if you always prefer working alone and are relatively comfortable with coding, I think that\u2019s doable (I worked alone so I couldn\u2019t speak for others, but you may end up finding really good partners!). Unless the syllabus said you must work with a partner although I doubt they forced that(certain they recommend it). You can also change the decision in the middle of the semester I believe whether you like one way or the other. Usually they were flexible. Just double check the syllabus or talk with instructors bc the policy might have been updated. If they do provide the options, don\u2019t be afraid to try and choose the option you are most comfortable with and that you can do your best.", "If you can find a time to meet with them regularly before the deadline, it should be good. Having a partner can be invaluable but it can also be hit or miss in terms of how much they want to put in or how much they know. I was lucky and was paired with a friend of mine in Econ/Data Sci. Office hours will quickly fill up, so if you have someone else to talk to more readily it can be really advantageous. I would say try talking to people and gauging their work ethic to see if they'd be a good partner. Your lab is a good time to connect with others!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/10kjvq0/cs_220_partners/"}
