{"content": "POST 1: \nThe user in this post received a bad grade in Econ 102 and is wondering if there is a class curve, which may help them improve their grade. Comments suggest that the professor or TA may be able to inform them about a potential curve, and that many econ classes are curved, especially those with heavier grading. A class curve could potentially help the user improve their standing in the class.\n\nPOST 2: \nComparing Econ 101 and 102, students note that 101 has more algebra-based problems, while 102 is theory-based. Professor Gwen Eudey is highly recommended for 102, as she is said to make the material accessible and engaging. Students suggest that students should be prepared for the differences between the two courses and consider taking an early lecture to get a feel for Eudey's teaching style.\n\nPOST 3: \nStudents warn others about taking Econ 102 with Professor Steven Rick, citing mixed reviews of his teaching style and suggesting that students will be left to teach themselves the material. Comments advise students to thoroughly review the course material before and after class to make up for Rick's lack of instruction."}
