{"title": "CS577 (Algorithms) practice problems?", "body": "To those that have taken CS577 before,\n\nWhere can I find more practice problems? Preferably with solutions. Any websites/YouTube videos, etc?\n\nI do the questions on the textbook but there are only a few and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to cement my understanding. Marc\u2019s homeworks are completely from the textbook, so he doesn\u2019t give out new questions either. I feel completely unprepared.\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken a previous version of 577 and still have access to your homework problems, would you consider sharing it with me?", "comments": ["http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/", "[deleted]", "Codeforces.com have algorithmic contests with detailed solutions.
