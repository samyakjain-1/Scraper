{"title": "Is it best to take CS 577 immediately after CS 240 so discrete math techniques are still fresh?", "body": "I know CS 577 - Intro to algorithms is supposed to be a difficult class.  I'm about to finish CS 400 and CS 240 this semester which means I can technically take CS 577 next semester.  Is it smart to try to just get it done with ASAP while I still remember the discrete math techniques, or will this just a pain no matter when I take it?", "comments": ["It's a difficult class. It might be advantageous to have that 240 knowledge fresh in your mind, then again the start is slow enough that there's time to pick it back up. Do what works best for your schedule and make sure your course load outside of 577 allows for you to put in the time & effort algo requires.", "I did take 577 right after 240 and to my best recollection induction was the only thing from 240 you really need to remember for 577. As long as you can hold on to the basics of proving an algorithm and induction you should be fine with a gap between those two classes but taking 577 immediately after 240 does have an advantage, it\u2019s just not that significant . I would also recommend not taking 577 with any other time consuming class like 354 or 530.", "577 wasn't that bad, and having 240 fresh certainly won't hurt you if you are worried about it."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/jz5w5o/is_it_best_to_take_cs_577_immediately_after_cs/"}
