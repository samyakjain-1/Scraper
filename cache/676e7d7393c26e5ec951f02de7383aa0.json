I also watched students get together, taking screenshots and deducing the right answer by staggering attempts round-robin style on canvas quizzes to maximize points (kind of reminded me of people doing CS 354 homework).\n\nOur class also crashed the Linux servers on every other project and I knew people who passed 0/0 unit tests on multiple projects.\n\nI think you will be okay. CS classes at these levels usually push people into the C bin. Unless you've missed an exam or skipped a bunch of projects this should be the lowest grade you get.", "I think I was around a 69-73% and that mapped to an AB when I took it, so the curve is pretty generous."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/k5o7el/will_cs537_intro_to_operating_systems_be_curved/"}
