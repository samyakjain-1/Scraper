{"title": "CS 540 Workload and Difficulty ?", "body": "I've got a chance to get off the waitlist and join Chuck's class this sem. But I'm already doing a Comm B class, CS 400, CS 240 and Music 101 along with an campus-job. I don't want to screw up my grade in any class. On average, for a decent programmer, how many hours would I need outside the classroom to get a clear A in CS 540 ? Also, how hard would it be to do well in the class without going to lecture ? Advice ? Thanks.", "comments": ["http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dyer/cs540/hw-toc.html\n\nYou can view all the slides and homework that has been released so far to get a feel for material and difficulty of the course", "I took CS 540 alongside CS 400 and the courseload for both together wasn't too bad. It's definitely a hard class, and I think if you have 240 along with it plus Comm b you might not have enough time to do what you need. I'd recommend just taking it next semester, you really only need to take two CS classes per semester to finish the major."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/d3d1kz/cs_540_workload_and_difficulty/"}
