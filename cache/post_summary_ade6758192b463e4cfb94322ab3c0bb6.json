{"content": "I took Econ 102 under Prof Rick, and the curriculum was designed to test students' understanding of economic concepts. The key takeaway was that the course was not just about memorizing formulas, but rather about applying economic principles to real-world scenarios. The tests were challenging, but I was able to prepare well thanks to Prof Rick's guidance."}
