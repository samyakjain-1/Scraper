{"title": "CS564 C++/Python Knowledge", "body": "Hi all,\n\nI am taking CS 564 this semester but I didn't know that Python and C++ were required, and I have little experience with Python and no experience with C++ (but I know Java). How screwed am I? Should I just drop? \n\nThanks!", "comments": ["Very many of your classmates are probably in the same situation, as was I when I took the class. As far as I remember, you only need python for the first assignment and you only need basic knowledge of the language to work on it. For C++, you can look at the boilerplate code that they give you for each assignment if you're unsure about syntax, but other than that you can code most of your solutions the same way you would in C/Java. If there is something that differs between the two, you can just run your program and correct the errors accordingly. And finally, if you're really stuck, the TAs will be able to catch any C++ errors you might have made, so you can visit them during office hours.", "If you took 354 here, you\u2019d know C. C++ is just some more stuff beyond C. Python is a very easy language indeed. Also usually the first assignment is to get you familiar with C++"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/l4p1e0/cs564_cpython_knowledge/"}
