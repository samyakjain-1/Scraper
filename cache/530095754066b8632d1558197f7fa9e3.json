The lecture slides are quite informative and I'll encourage you to go through them before exams thoroughly. showing up to lecture also helps. The projects are easy but the midterm and final exam count A LOT. I had a 94% before the final but ended up with an B after bombing the finals with an 85/100. Still recovering.", "If Anhai still teaches this course next semester, enroll in his section. You do not have to prepare a lot. If you want, you can learn some basic C++ coding skills. I took his course in the Fall of 2022, and he knows how to teach well. You won't feel tired because he will talk about something funny or give you some of his reflections on life besides talking about the course content. He explains everything clearly, and if you have any questions, ask him immediately and he will answer it with patience. The workload and assignments will be adjusted based on real situations. Exams are not too hard, and one A4-page of cheat sheet is allowed. Just pay attention to details and review on time.", "Everyone mentions C++ when it comes to CS 564, and I don't know a thing about C++. We only learn Java and C in prior courses. I'm worried about going into a course that uses a programming language I don't know about. How does the instructor expect students to learn it? I read it's a difficult and complex language."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/102lcxk/cs564_prep/"}
