{"title": "Summer Term CS537 or CS577", "body": "Hi fellow badgers!\n\nI'm planning to take either CS537 or CS577 this summer. I was just wondering if anyone had any information about the professors offering the classes this summer term, or any other advice or Discord servers to join for these classes. If anyone else is also planning to take one of these classes and wants someone to communicate and study with me or others as well, feel free to hit me up.\n\nCS537 is going to be taught by Yuvraj Patel who seems to be a grad student, and I don't know too much about. CS577 is going to be taught by Jiazhen Zhou who seems to have taught this in previous summer terms and is a professor at Whitewater. Does anyone have any recommendations or knowledge about these professors?", "comments": ["Usually associate or visiting assistant professors (postdocs, newly accepted, working towards tenure) are the kindest ones and always keep in mind their students' humanity since they were recently (or still are) a subset of the students they plan on teaching.\n\nThe 577 professor has some [feedback](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1769466) but I think courses at this level demand more from the students regardless, so gauge like that.", "https://discord.gg/XpnQU2bv\n\nThe compsci discord might be able to help", "[deleted]"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/natql7/summer_term_cs537_or_cs577/"}
