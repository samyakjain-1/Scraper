{"title": "Thoughts on cs577,537,564 in one semester?", "body": "Has anyone done that before? How is that feeling?\n\nI might also add one lit/humanity course.\n\nI did pretty well on lower-level CS courses and have learned some algorithm design/OS knowledge. Is that doable(without too much pain)?\n\nMore specifically, I took algorithm design courses in my original college(but only counted as advanced selected courses as transfer credits), and I got a BC in that course without paying any attention(since I am going to transfer to UW).", "comments": ["That sounds like a hellish trifecta. If it\u2019s your only option, then perhaps doable. But 537 is no joke, very time consuming. And you can pass 577 with some decent effort, but getting anything higher than a B will require significant practice. 564 is the less daunting of the three, but still takes up time.", "cs577 and 537 are known to be the two most difficult comp sci classes here. don\u2019t take them at the same time", "i took those 3 together without any other classes (would not recommend adding another course). it was definitely doable for me but be prepared to have very little free time"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1ja075i/thoughts_on_cs577537564_in_one_semester/"}
