Should I just write an email to the professor expressing my interest and go on from there? Or is there any other process?", "comments": ["You probably won\u2019t be able to be a TA since that\u2019s for mostly grad students\n\nPeer mentor, I would ask your advisor first", "Usually there\u2019s an interest form for being a peer mentor sent to the CS mailing list at the end of every semester. Otherwise, just email one of the professors who is teaching it in the spring and express interest. Let them know you took the class previously and the fact that you got a good grade (I assume)", "email Andrew Kuemmel"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/yqrz8t/process_for_becoming_a_tapeer_mentor_for_cs_220/"}
