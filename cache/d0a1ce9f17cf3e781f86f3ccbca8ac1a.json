{"title": "Requisites problem with CS 320", "body": "Hi guys,\n\nDoes anyone know the meaning of the rule of requisites of CS 320. On the website of course search, it shows that \n\nRequisites \n\nCOMP SCI 220( or COMP SCI 301 prior to Spring 2020), COMP SCI 300, 319, graduate/professional standing\u2026..\n\nFrom my understanding, although I didn\u2019t take the 220, 301, 300, 319 before, I am a graduate student who majors in M.S. business analytics. Therefore, I can still take this course.\n\nIs my understanding right?\n\nThanks!", "comments": ["That\u2019s is correct in an \u201cor\u201d situation.
