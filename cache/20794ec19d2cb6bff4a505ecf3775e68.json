Second exam, I had a study group I studied religiously the whole semester. Easily 15 hours or more a week.\n\nAnyways, prep our asses off for the exam. Walk in, all walk out later and shout a series of, \"what in the actual fuck was that, anyone finish it?\n\nTA section comes, all of us dreading what we know is coming. TA walks in within a word, draws a huge 23 (I forget exactly what it was). Points at it and says \"that is an A\"\n\nIt was an exam out of 100, you needed a 7 or lower to fail. Keep your chin up, everyone probably felt that way. Hope for a heavy curve.", "i always leave exams feeling overconfident and end up almost failing \ud83d\ude43"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/t4mv0q/math_222_exam_1/"}
