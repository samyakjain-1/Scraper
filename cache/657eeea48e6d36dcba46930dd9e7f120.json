{"title": "How is ECON 100?", "body": "I'm an incoming freshman planning to major in physics. I didn't study economics in my junior and senior year, but I studied the basics of it in the 9th and 10th grade. Is this class meant for people like me without any background in econ? Also is this a work intensive class?", "comments": ["Bias Econ major who graduated two years ago, but you should definitely take the class. Nothing too difficult. Relatively interesting topics about current events as well as theory. Don\u2019t have to agree with it, but I think everyone should take at least one Econ class.", "It's a 100 level course, its meant for anyone. It's not too hard", "I think you\u2019ll be able to do just fine, as a 100 level class it is designed for students new to the subject. And no the workload is not too intense"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/hwe0xk/how_is_econ_100/"}
