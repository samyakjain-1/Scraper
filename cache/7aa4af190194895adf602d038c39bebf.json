{"title": "Should I drop CS 220", "body": "Hello, I need a little a bit of advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a CS freshman at UW Madison and I'm starting with CS 300 as I have credit from AP Computer Science. I am also contemplating dual majoring with Data Science. For that reason, I also took CS 220 as it was Data Science Programming 1. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI already know Python (in addition to knowing Java). I've gone through the syllabus of CS220 and I find the first five weeks extremely easy (functions, iterations, conditionals etc) and I'm already familiar with the contents of the next 5 weeks (lists, dictionaries, tuples). However, when it comes to last five weeks, there's some stuff I'm not familiar with such as HTML and plotting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it worth taking CS 220 if I already know like 70% or would it be a better use of time to just learn plotting and HTML stuff on my own?\n\nShould I drop CS 220 and replace it with some gen ed course for this semester and then directly take CS 320 next semester? Would CS 320 be manageable if your taking it after CS 300?", "comments": ["I'd suggest reaching out to the instructor of 220 and/or 320 and asking for their thoughts. I'm not super familiar with the requirements of the sequence anymore, but when I taught the class-that-would-become-220 folks from 300 were pretty bored.", "Consider taking 320 and just filling in the gaps yourself, might be more worth your time", "i\u2019ve taken cs220 and cs320. many people in cs320 were able to pretty easily get up to speed in python. IMO it\u2019s a better use of time to go to CS320 from CS300. but if you want a lot of practice in python, might still be worth taking cs 220."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/16bpuze/should_i_drop_cs_220/"}
