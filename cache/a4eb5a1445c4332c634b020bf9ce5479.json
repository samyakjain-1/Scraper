{"title": "I have a D in CS200 how badly will this mess up college for me?", "body": "Currently I have a C in CS200 mostly due to me missing 3 human graded projects and half of my zylab weekly programs which are about 30% of my grade. I actually did most of them but I had really bad problems with procrastination for this class so i would turn in material late and apparently late work can\u2019t be graded. The material in class itself wasn\u2019t all that hard as I have an B avg on exams and got an A on my final with minimal studying. I just had problems turning in work on time. I know these are all excuses but how badly will this mess up my record as a CS major?\n\nEdit: Sorry for the D in the title I checked my grade while writing and realized it\u2019s been updated to a C!\nalso to provide context im a freshman and I have a B in linear algebra which I think is a CS major class", "comments": ["If you\u2019re planning on being a CS major, you will probably have a VERY tough time in future courses.", "I don't understand why people come to college and actively choose to not do work. One C will not end your career but failing to change bad habits will.", "You got bigger problems that this grade. If you can\u2019t put in the effort for an intro level course like this, how do you expect to succeed in college at all, much less as a CS major? Your classes will only get harder and more time intensive.\n\nIf you really are having this much trouble focusing, this could be due to something more. Learning to manage your own time for the first time can be difficult, but most people figure it out by the first semester. You could have ADHD or something along those lines. I obviously don\u2019t know you outside of what you say in this post, but if it does sound like something you might have, you should follow up with an actual psychologist."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/18mk052/i_have_a_d_in_cs200_how_badly_will_this_mess_up/"}
