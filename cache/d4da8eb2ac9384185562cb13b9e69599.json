{"title": "CS536 vs CS537", "body": "I need to take one of the two this semester. Which one has a lighter workload? 536 is only 3 credits but seems to have more homework/projects as compared to 537. But debugging/coding would probably be harder in 537 because it is in C and 536 is in java.", "comments": ["537 will almost certainly be more work, but I would also argue it is a more valuable class for most.", "C > Java, always. Screw Java.\n\nPersonal opinions aside,  though, it's valuable to learn more languages - especially C, which has no inkling of object-orientation beyond a `struct`, which doesn't count. OO programming reigns supreme in the software industry, but knowing other paradigms is still highly valuable.  It will broaden your horizons and introduce you to new ways of thinking about problems.  Go with 537 if you think you can handle it."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/d21hyj/cs536_vs_cs537/"}
