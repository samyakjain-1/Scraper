{"title": "CS 320", "body": "I\u2019m taking this course without any prior Python experience. Would yall recommend any other online materials for supporting and also any online content that has similar syllabus with this course for additional help.", "comments": ["Do you any programming experience? If not, then you\u2019ll have to work extra hard. If you can program in another language, then learning python (or any new language) is easier than learning the first.\n\n320 requires cs220, cs300, cs301 (if taken before spring 2020) unless you are a grad/professional student or in the Computer Sciences for Professionals Capstone Certificate\n\ncs220 is the intro version of cs320. Look for the syllabus online, Meena Syamkumar usually teaches 220 and 320. You can find old semesters with all of the lectures and labs. This is probably the best way to learn python for 320", "Python is extremely easy, every Java programmer can do it with nearly no effort", "You should be fine, but there's also CS 368, which is a 1 credit course that has different sections meant to help you transition from one programming language to another, so you can take the \"Python for Java Programmers\" section. I took the reverse section last year (\"Java for Python Programmers\") when I was taking CS300 after only having taken 220 and 320, and it just gave me extra practice to get used to thinking in Java rather than Python -- it wasn't EXTREMELY helpful since it was just a 1 credit course with online modules, but it could help."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/19fc6nv/cs_320/"}
