{"title": "What's Math 222 like?", "body": "Hey I'm an incoming freshman and I got credit for Math 221 from IB exams so I'm just planning on doing 222 straight away. \n\nI've been looking through some sites and saw that a lot of people have a strong distaste for this class. Is it cause of the professors? Is the content actually hard? I took HL Math Analysis and Approaches for example. \n\nI found a Fall '16 syllabus from Rachel Davis  and was also wondering if other syllabi from other professors are related to it.", "comments": ["I think the distaste mainly comes from how poorly the math department at UW is organized, as a whole. Not to mention that a lot of the professors are not good teachers, some have strong accents that make it difficult to even understand them when they\u2019re rushing to finish a problem, not so helpful TAs, exams worth 1/3 of your grade, etc. I was in a similar situation and took 221 as easy credit. Was easy as I already knew the material, but if you didn\u2019t, I could see how you could struggle. I ended up not taking 222 cause of my experience.", "The content is hard but not impossible. The biggest issue I had with the class was how fast paced it was. You are learning a lot of new things every class and don\u2019t have time to master concepts.", "You should save your money if ur getting \"free\" credits. I got a lot from my IB HL exams too. I think you should do 222 but if u really want a good grade like an A or AB without doing too much work then do the 221 first. If I were u I would take the free credit."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/oiqifr/whats_math_222_like/"}
