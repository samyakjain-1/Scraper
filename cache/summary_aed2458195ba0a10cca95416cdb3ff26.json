{"content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize opinions from Reddit about CS 537. The user has provided some posts and comments. Let me go through each one and extract the key points.\n\nFirst post is about resources for CS 537 and exams. The OP is neutral, just providing info. The comments are positive, thanking the OP. So this suggests the resources are helpful.\n\nSecond post asks if CS 537 is worth it. The OP is a senior considering taking it and is aware it's a lot of work. The comments mention it's hard but valuable. One comment talks about using Remzi\u2019s book and difficulty, another from someone who graduated in 2012 and found it useful in their career. So mixed feelings but overall positive about the value.\n\nThird post strongly advises against taking CS 537, saying it's terrible with too much work and difficulty. They've taken other tough classes but found 537 overwhelming. However, the comments disagree, with someone praising it as the best class they took with Miller, and another saying not to be discouraged.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\n1. High workload and difficulty are consistent points. Both positive and negative comments mention this.\n2. The course is considered valuable and applicable in real-world, especially for systems programming. Alumni support this.\n3. Professors matter. Miller seems to be recommended, while another professor made someone quit.\n4. Resources and community help are important. The first post shows that having good resources can make a difference.\n5. It's a love-hate course. Some find it best, others terrible.\n\nI should structure these into 5 bullet points, including advice and professor recs where mentioned.\n</think>\n\n**Summary of Reddit Opinions on CS 537**\n\n- **High Workload and Difficulty**: Consistently mentioned as challenging, with projects and exams requiring significant effort.\n- **Valuable and Applicable**: Often highlighted for its real-world relevance, particularly in systems programming and software development careers.\n- **Professor Impact**: Professor Miller is highly recommended for a positive experience, while others had negative experiences with different professors.\n- **Resource Availability**: Access to good resources and a supportive community can greatly enhance the learning experience.\n- **Mixed Reviews**: While some find it rewarding and the best course they've taken, others warn of its intense difficulty and stress."}
