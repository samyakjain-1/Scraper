But, if you want a head start, learn as much python as you can before the summer ends.", "I took it last year, as someone who had very minimal python knowledge. You don\u2019t NEED to prepare yourself for anything, but it definitely helped me to know some of the really basic concepts and since you know a tiny bit of python thats definitely enough. \n\nI would say the hardest part about it is definitely the projects, they\u2019re not super difficult if you understand the content but they are pretty time consuming, especially as the semester goes on. They\u2019re also a large part of your grade so they need a lot of effort. I would recommend getting a partner for the last couple projects, and try to go to office hours as early as you can, since it gets crowded a couple days before a project is due. \n\nThe lectures are completely based on the professor imo, id recommend Micheal Doescher since he apparently teaches pretty well. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to worry about the exams that much, they\u2019re all multiple choice questions and aren\u2019t a huge part of your grade. \n\nHope that helps!!", "CS220 is designed for people who\u2019ve never coded/have very little coding experience; they\u2019ll go through basic aspects of Python like data types, data manipulation, graphing, Pandas, some SQL, and so on."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1du629f/cs_220_advice/"}
