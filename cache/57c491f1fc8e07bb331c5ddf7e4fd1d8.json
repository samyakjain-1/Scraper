{"title": "Econ 102 Grade...How doomed am I?", "body": "Okay, Okay, So,\n\nI am a sophomore in Econ102 with Stella Chan and recently got back my second midterm...and I got a pretty bad grade. Right now I'm sitting with a 79% in the class overall, I attend every discussion, and do fairly well on the problem sets.\n\nMy questions:\n\nIs there a class curve?\n\nWhat is the final like?\n\nWhat is the most effective way to study?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!", "comments": ["Ask the professor/TA if you're trying a lot of teachers will keep you from failing if that's your concern. Also drop deadline is Friday, so ask now. \n\nYou could also look into calculating your grade in a spreadsheet and seeing what grades you need on assignments to pass.", "AFAIK a lot of classes in the econ dept are curved, and many of them are curved heavily by percentile class performance. you can tell by the fact that letter grade distributions for econ courses (see [madgrades.com](https://madgrades.com)) are pretty constant, with the top \\~15-20% of students getting As, the next 15-20% getting ABs, and so on. if your syllabus doesn't mention anything about this, email your TA and professor about your standing in the class.  \nI can say from experience that doing well in an econ class is all about practice. do lots of practice problems, go to office hours and get every step of the math explained to you."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/z2cxdm/econ_102_gradehow_doomed_am_i/"}
