{"title": "CS 537 (OS) + CS 571 (Building UI)?", "body": "Just wondering if taking the two together would be a bad idea. I know 537 has a really high workload, and I've heard that CS 571 has a pretty high workload too.\n\nAnyone taking 571 this semester? What are your thoughts about the course structure/workload?", "comments": ["CS 571 is a new course. It used to be CS 639 under professor Mutlu in Fall 19 and Fall 20. It's a really good class and is probably the most useful and real life relevant class I have taken. Sad to see that Mutlu will not be teaching next semester since he designed the course. It is quite a lot of work but your grade will comprised on 3 major projects and 2 exams. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have not yet taken OS but 571 is quite time intensive especially on the weeks that you have to pass up your coding assignment. But it's a very very useful course that I will recommend you taking and consider defer OS for the mean time."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/mrpucj/cs_537_os_cs_571_building_ui/"}
