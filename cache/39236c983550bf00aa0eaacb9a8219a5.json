{"title": "CS 320 Online Summar", "body": "I'm thinking of taking CS 320 online this semester as I'm a data science major and want to kind of catch up with other people in my major who've probably already taken this class (also I'm double majoring so I kinda need to take summer courses). I didnt take 220 because my counselor said to take 300 because I had AP CSA credit (which im kinda regretting cuz 300 is quite hard). Overall in 300 I feel like actual coding wise im fine but the class pace is just so bad and I got the bad lecturer professor so it's not a very fun experience. I want to know if it would be alot harder online over the summer. I do have support at home as my mom is a full time programmer. The teacher for the class is Gurmail Singh and he has bad reviews similar to my current professor Mouna and i just want to know if I will still be able to get an A in the class with a bad professor", "comments": ["cs320 is very easy right now this semester with gurmail", "Hi! I\u2019m also thinking off taking comp Sci 320 online with Singh. I\u2019m taking 220 this semester and im doing okay. The people I\u2019ve talked to about it said 320 is easier than 220 and that it\u2019s a time consuming class that\u2019s better to do by itself than with other classes during a regular semester."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1bcalfj/cs_320_online_summar/"}
