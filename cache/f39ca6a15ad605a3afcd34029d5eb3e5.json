{"title": "CS 320 with Gurmail Singh VS Yiyin Shen", "body": "I'm not sure who to take CS 320 with and was wondering if anyone knew whether the lectures for CS 320 (with either of these professors) are recorded? ", "comments": ["Yiyin Shen was a pretty good prof imo. However, for me CS320 switched profs after the first midterm, idk if this is normal, but if it is, then youll have her for the first half if you choose her as your prof when you sign up for the course. \n\nHer lectures are recorded, but you'll end up having to attend them as there are in class quizzes (of one question usually) that you need to submit within 15 minutes after class ends.", "I had 220 with Singh and they weren't recorded so I would assume that would be the same for 320. I also wasn't a huge fan of his teaching style, just spent most of the time showing us what we needed to do with little explanation.", "Take it with Yiyin. She's nice. At least she follows the design of this course by Tyler, which I think is a very nicely designed version of this class. Gurmail might not teach this class the same way and he never taught this class before."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/17lr6f8/cs_320_with_gurmail_singh_vs_yiyin_shen/"}
