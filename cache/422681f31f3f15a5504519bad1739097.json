You are in good hands either way to be completely honest.", "Never had Johnson. But I took Professor Eudey for 302. She\u2019s a really sweet professor that is very helpful in office hours. She\u2019s very clear of what will be on tests. Interesting lectures and makes them relevant to current events. Hope this helps!", "gwen eudey is so adorable! i had her class this summer completely online and i enjoyed watching the videos, she was so nice and really cares"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/k500qg/econ_102_johnson_vs_eudy/"}
