You need to be studying a little every day", "The best way to go about these exams is to DO PRACTICE that is given. There are lots of practice exams available, and a lot of times the questions you see on the exam are similar to the practice. I did not study a ton, but this helped me get a 90+ on each exam in the class. It is challenging, but doable! It is hard to balance with other hard classes, and you are still learning how to do that, so it is ok!", "I got a 65.5"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1g8gb15/anyone_else_fail_their_math_222_exam_or_was_that/"}
