{"title": "Comp Sci 300 and Comp Sci 320 at the same time?", "body": "I am a DS major, but considering double major with CS. I have 5 semesters left. For a few of the higher level CS classes I'm interested in (for future semesters) you need CS 400. For CS 400, you need CS 300, CS 320 doesn't suffice ig. So, is it a bad idea to take CS 300 and CS 320 at the same time? I would be taking them along with math 222, lis 202, and littrans 247.  Thoughts on this?", "comments": ["Important question: have you taken 200 or would you be picking up Java on the fly", "Just take CS 757 (Advanced Computer Architecture II: Parallelism) first, and then you can take everything at once the next semester.", "i did this last semester, the project load can be a pain but its definitely doable.
