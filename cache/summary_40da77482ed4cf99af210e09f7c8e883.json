{"content": "POST 1: The original poster is seeking help in preparing for the CS540 midterm exams, finding the provided slides to be insufficient and previous lecture videos outdated due to syllabus changes. They are looking for alternative study materials and advice from those who have previously taken the class. However, the comments received so far have been unhelpful, with some users making jokes or stating that the materials are not available.\n\nPOST 2: The original poster is inquiring about the grading threshold for a B, AB, and A in the CS540 class, currently sitting at an 86% and wondering how it compares to the calculated median and mean. Another user has expressed the same concern, also having an 86%, while a comment mentions that the grade distributions have been posted on Piazza. The poster is seeking more specific information on the cutoffs for each grade.\n\nPOST 3: The original poster has realized that CS540 builds on the foundations of linear algebra, but they have no prior knowledge of the subject, feeling unprepared for the course. A commenter who has taken CS540 suggests that linear algebra should almost be a prerequisite and recommends starting with 3blue1brown videos to learn the necessary concepts. Another commenter agrees that linear algebra is crucial and shares their own experience of taking the subject before CS540."}
