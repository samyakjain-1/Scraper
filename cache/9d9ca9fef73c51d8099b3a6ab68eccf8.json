{"title": "CS536 or CS564", "body": "Fellow CS Badgers,\n\n**I'm curious about your experiences with CS536 (Compilers) and CS564 (Databases)**. \n\nFor those of you who have taken either, or both, I would love to hear your experience in both classes / if you would recommend taking it (workload, expectations, etc.). I am currently enrolled in **CS536 w/ Albarghouthi** but am wondering if it's a class I'll find useful/interesting or if I should try to get off the **CS564 waitlist w/ Koutris.**", "comments": ["Compilers was a lot of work but you learn a lot of abstract ideas that are cool especially with tree walking. I found it an interesting class and fun to understand how compiled languages work. Id say neither are too useful irl because even though you learn databases, most db design could be taught in a few days. But once you get past the useful basics you start getting into less useful things like implementing B+ trees and dealing with relational algebra. Id say - take whatever sounds interesting to you if you can get into both because both teach you how things work in the background. ", "I took 564 with Koutris, I didn\u2019t go to lecture because I found his lecture style and accent unhelpful and hard to sit through. Overall the class was somewhat difficult but not too bad. I don\u2019t know much about the other class but I think in most areas of computer science database knowledge would be more valuable than compilers. I\u2019m still a student though so take that with a grain of salt."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/9b2k6i/cs536_or_cs564/"}
