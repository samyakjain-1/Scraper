{"title": "Is CS 200 difficult with PHY 207 and MATH 222?", "body": "Hey everyone! I'm a freshman who's planning to take these 3 classes next semester. Do you think the workload will be too much if I take these 3 classes? I just have a little experience with programming and only know the basics. I know basics of python and matlab but this class is in java. I'm interested in this class because it will be introduce me to the \"programming mindset\". I'm planning to major in physics, and I'm considering to major in CS as well. But I'm worried that these 3 classes might be too much for me. Any inputs or suggestions would be appreciated!", "comments": ["Honestly it\u2019s kind of hard to say. CS 200 has such a range of people taking it. Some people think it\u2019s an absolute breeze and others really struggle. Since you said you have some programming experience, I think you should be okay taking it at the same time as your other courses.", "CS 200 is a class that if you do all the work, which is not an insignificant but not too much either, you will probably get an A, or atleast that\u2019s my experience with it. Kinda the perfect COVID semester class to take if you\u2019re interested in comp Sci", "I've heard mixed reviews of 200- I know my friends who took it last semester didn't watch the lectures and usually just taught themselves. I definitely think you should try to take it!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/kklk6b/is_cs_200_difficult_with_phy_207_and_math_222/"}
