{"content": "I took Econ 102 last semester with Prof Rick and found the course to be well-structured and engaging. While I didn't encounter any technical issues, I did have to review some notes from the previous semester to prepare for the course. However, Prof Rick's expectations for the course were realistic, and I'm confident that I'll perform well."}
