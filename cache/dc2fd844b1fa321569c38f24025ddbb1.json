{"title": "CS 537 As A Senior (or 536/538)", "body": "I need one more Hardware/Software class for my degree. I\u2019m taking 506 right now. I really wanted to take CS 564, databases, however it\u2019s not being offered.\n\nIm graduating this Spring, and Ide honestly love to have an easy-ish final semester. I\u2019m considering taking 536 or 538, since they are 3 credits and apparently not crazy tough. However I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s just not smart to enter the industry without taking 537, operating systems. I\u2019m just a bit worried about getting smacked with a big tough class in my last semester.\n\nAnyone have any insight? Do I need 537? Are 536/538 industry applicable as well?", "comments": ["CS 564 is offered in the spring. But closed, it\u2019s because it have 30 seats atm but it will add more seats on the way. If you really want to take it, just wait a bit. Other than that, out of the 3 you listed cs 537 would more useful compare to 536 (PL and compilers) and 538 (PL). Learning how application work on OS is essential for programmers in my opinion. But that CS 537 won\u2019t be easy tbh.", "Take CS 537"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/yvckof/cs_537_as_a_senior_or_536538/"}
