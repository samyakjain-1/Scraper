{"title": "CS 220 (Data Science Programming 1) to CS 300 (Computer Science Programming 2)?", "body": "I\u2019m gonna do double major in CS and DS and just finished the level-1 programming for DS. Should I take CS 200 or go straight to CS 300, cause it uses a whole new language (Java instead of Python)? I will also take CS 368: *Java for Python learners*, so I think it\u2019s doable.\nA little background about me: no coding experience whatsoever, but so far I have 98% for CS 220 (and yes, I know it\u2019s not as hard as CS 200)", "comments": ["Take CS300 you will be fine!", "I just did the same thing you're doing this semester, and I'm doing fine (also with no prior coding experience). The first project takes a while, but you get used to Java by the second and third. You'll do fine!", "There's a 1 credit CS368 for ppl switching from python to Java if you want the add'l support during 300 (LEC 003 or 004). Only meets for about a month at the beginning of the semester."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/zie674/cs_220_data_science_programming_1_to_cs_300/"}
