However, seem that CS540 is the only option. Can someone give me some review and advices about this course and what professor I should register for. Thanks. Also can you introduce to me courses that related or may helpful about AI. I appreciate that.", "comments": ["it\u2019s a pretty generic and introductory course. Covers a broad range of topics but does not go deep in each of them. Projects and Exams are not too hard.", "Fred Sala is the goat. Not sure if he\u2019s teaching it next semester or not though. You just need a bit of linear algebra background because you use matrices A LOT.", "There's like 10 other AI/ML courses here that I know of just off the top of my head. Check out the cs course list and other depts like stats or math"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gun9d1/introduction_to_artificial_intelligencecomp_sci/"}
