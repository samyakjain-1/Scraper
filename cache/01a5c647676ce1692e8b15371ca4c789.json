{"title": "Econ 102", "body": "I\u2019m taking Econ 102 in the fall with Steven Rick. I\u2019ve heard mixed reviews about his way of teaching. For anyone who has taken Econ 102 with Professor Rick, how should I prepare for his course (lectures and his exams)? What kind of textbook does he use? ", "comments": ["Do not take it with Steve Rick!! He will not teach the material at all. Be prepared to learn some random Econ things that u will be putting on his slides (blue notes) which are incredibly huge amount of info that he will put on the exams. Plus for some reason he will be teaching Latin. There will be Latin phrases questions on the exam. Avoid the hassle and do not take it will him", "I agree with the other comment here. If you take it with Steve, you will be teaching yourself the whole class and relying heavily on your poor TAs. His \"blue box\" info on exams only makes up about 20% of exam material and he does not teach the textbook."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1cod6sk/econ_102/"}
