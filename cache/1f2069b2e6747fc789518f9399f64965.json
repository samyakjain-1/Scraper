{"title": "Is CS540 doable for non CS student with only limited knowledge of python?", "body": "I am a Visiting International Student in UWM for this fall semester only, and I am now taking some online courses like UCB cs 61a to get me familiarized with programming, which is helpful because I want to do NLP some day. And now the knowledge I got enables me to finish the homework of CS61a on my own, including High-order functions, recursive functions and object oriented programming, etc.   And that's my background.\n\nOne of my friends recommend CS540 to me based on its description, and I looked through its reviews and feel confused. He also recommended 545(strongly), 577( I know it's so hard so I crossed it off my list), 425, 471, 475.\n\nSO does anyone know, based on my background, is CS540 or any courses mentioned above doable for me or what else would you recommend? ( I have now enrolled in CS 300)", "comments": ["540(With Jerry Zhu) 's assignments have to be done in Java. You need to be comfortable with coding 500 lines program in Java. Besides, you don't need to know much about other things.\n\n[http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/\\~shavlik/cs540.html](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shavlik/cs540.html)\n\nClick this link for more details about homework and exams.\n\n540 is considered as one of the easiest 500 level CS courses in UW-M, I think you will be fine. However, I learnt very limited amount of knowledge from CS540, and the overall experience was trivial, I don't recommend it.", "I am taking it rn and I found that the coding itself isnt as tough as the math and notation. While certainly not required, linear algebra probability and multivariable calc will make the course a little easier and more interesting.
