God, fuck you Steve\n\nETA: so I talked to a buddy who did 1% worse than me in the class and his grade was posted as a B so somebody must have fucked up somewhere. I hope.", "comments": ["Classes that curve down are ridiculous.", "What were the averages on the exams? 100?", "Probably got a BC after your professor saw your cancerous post history. Jk, read the rest, might be helpful.\n\nAlso I looked at madgrades for that professor. If you\u2019re getting a BC you\u2019re doing worse than 62 percent of the class. He does have a pretty tough curve for As NGL but he gives out a lot of ABs and Bs. Nearly *half* the class gets an AB or B.\n\nIf you were doing above average on the tests and still got a BC I\u2019d advise emailing the professor. Did you forget to submit any assignments or skip discussion or attendance or something?It is possible they entered your grade wrong since you said you had an 86 and test averages were 70s."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/boljdv/econ_102_with_rick_wack_ass_curve/"}
