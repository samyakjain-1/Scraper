I know there's group projects so it's probably important to attend lectures to meet with people (?) but does anybody know anything?", "comments": ["There's videos on his youtube page, and the lectures are important but projects are more important. Group work is expected to be done outside of class", "If you have it with Tyler he records all the lectures. You meet with your group outside of class too", "I also wonder how do we find our group members? \nWill we have to find by ourselves, or professor will assign?\nThanks!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/qvizyg/cs_320_lecture/"}
