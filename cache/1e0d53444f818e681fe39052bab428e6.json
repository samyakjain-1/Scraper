{"title": "CS 537 + CS 564 (Databases + OS), how much work is it?", "body": "Title sums it up. I know that the advisors generally recommend 1 theory + 1 project CS class, but from lurking around in discords it seems that Databases isn't a particularly heavy workload. I also plan on taking CS 710 (Graduate Computational Complexity) and something to satisfy gen-eds for my other 2 courses.", "comments": ["537 has about 7-8 projects/assignments and 2-3 midterms. Each assignment has a workload of 7-8 hours on average. First two assignments are quite easy and don't take much time, but it gets worse later.", "I took 537 and 564 together last year. It was a decent amount of work but definitely doable. Just find good groups for both classes and you should be fine. And honestly some of the class materials kind of overlapped which was nice.", "Anecdotally, *a lot* of work*, but that answer is always relative and it's always more work than other things if all the concepts are  all new.\n\nAs others comment, 537 is Kinda Important.\n\nI'll concur with \"there's overlap between OS and DB concepts, and that'd probably help\"; if you have the time and don't need to work or anything it's doable just fine in the same semester, but don't... get complacent."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/qygaek/cs_537_cs_564_databases_os_how_much_work_is_it/"}
