{"content": "The user in this post received a bad grade in Econ 102 and is wondering if there is a class curve, which may help them improve their grade. Comments suggest that the professor or TA may be able to inform them about a potential curve, and that many econ classes are curved, especially those with heavier grading. A class curve could potentially help the user improve their standing in the class."}
