{"title": "CS200 for non major who knows nothing about CS", "body": "I\u2019m a senior majoring in Neurobio so nothing I have studied has had anything to do with CS. I have never taken a CS class before and have never done any programming/coding in my free time, I don\u2019t really even know what Java is tbh... I can\u2019t stress enough that I know absolutely nothing about this area of study. \n\nBut I\u2019ve been really interested in taking a computer science class at UW before I graduate and this is the last semester to do so. Is this course really for beginners with no experience like it says in the course description? I don\u2019t mind putting in a lot of work for this class either", "comments": ["I\u2019d recommend considering CS220. It\u2019s an introduction to programming using Python, and is intended for data science majors (not CS). I took it with Mike Doescher, who was both excellent instructor - really funny, friendly, and an engaging lecturer. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about neurobio, but proficiency with data organization (i.e. scraping), organization, and manipulation could be useful in grad school (If you pursue it) and/or in a professional setting.", "Yes they start ground up and assume you\u2019ve never even seen a line of code before", "As this is your final semester, as others mentioned, I think taking CS 200, you wouldn't get much out of it. However, CS 220 is MUCH better in your case and would be much more beneficial for your major since it's Data Programming and it focuses a lot on analyzing (and cleaning) data using codes.\n\nCS 200 is all about coding which is more useful unless you take more advanced programming courses."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/l37vnx/cs200_for_non_major_who_knows_nothing_about_cs/"}
