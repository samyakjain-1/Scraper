Any tips that I could prepare for this class?", "comments": ["Comment from another thread: Haven\u2019t taken the class, but have friends who have during the semester. It\u2019s a lot more programming based(70%), and I\u2019ve heard the projects are pretty GPTable so not to hard I\u2019m assuming. However I\u2019ve seen your practices exams which delve more into theory and computations. Overall if u have decent math skills and coding skills(even if no experience in Python) u should be set. Most of the computations I\u2019ve seen are linear algebra related tho", "This summer class is fantastic. Young Wu is the man. The class is well structured & you\u2019ll be fine without some big math background.  If you want to prepare, read Hands On Machine Learning by Aurelion Geron", "It's an easy course honestly. Like the other dude said its very project based. Just ace the projects (very doable; all in python) and you are good to go. \n\nI had a particularly busy semester when I took it, so l ended up not studying for the tests at all. I bombed both of them and still got an AB."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1dfszk8/thoughts_on_taking_cs_540_during_the_summer_with/"}
