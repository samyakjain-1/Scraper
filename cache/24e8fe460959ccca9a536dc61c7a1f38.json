{"title": "CS 220 professor", "body": "Does anyone who took CS220 before have a recommended professor? This year we have Meena Syamkumar, Gurmail Singh, and Michael Doescher. (like how about their grading policies and workload)", "comments": ["Meena is a terrific professor and person, I recommend her strongly.", "I had Andy in the spring, but my friend had Meena. Apparently she is very nice and the workload isn't that bad. I also heard from multiple people in the spring semester that Meena was the best out of the three professors and she made concepts easier to understand.", "I had Mike in the summer. Super nice and chill guy. He always made time for students and made himself available for questions. He\u2019s experienced in other programming languages and admits that python is not what he is most familiar with. However, I never ran into issues with his lectures and understanding the way he taught the concepts. He relies on live coding in lecture a lot, which I think was beneficial to me. I assume that the workload is the same for each professor, but in the summer it was not very heavy. The course is project heavy and the largest portion of your final grade will rely on the projects, but you get to work on them with a partner."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/x21zla/cs_220_professor/"}
