It was probably because i was such a mess mentally.\n\nI've been considering applying for re-entry, and I've been looking up old 222 exams/quizzes to freshen my mind. Honestly, even though i have a very bad track record in math, just a little reading/chatgpt explanations of practice problems/youtube vids, and I feel like i could tackle one of these quizzes or exams. back then it felt nearly impossible, and when i looked at those problems on exam days it felt like a foreign language. But that was probably just because i never reached out for any tutoring or to TA's for help, and neglected lectures and discussion.\n\nIf you're not already insanely good at math, go to every lecture and discussion, look up old exams/quizzes for practice, and ask for more help if you need it. And don't let yourself fall behind, not even just a few days.\n\n(sorry i know OP didnt ask, this is just a general comment for anyone who finds this in the future)", "All 222 instructors share exams and old exams are posted in Canvas."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gcttnz/math_222/"}
