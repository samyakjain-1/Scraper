{"title": "How to study CS 220", "body": "I\u2019m so frustrated over this subject! I have been studying for it for hours but I still manage to not get it. Moreover, my grades are below the lower quartile in the project/ Quiz\u2026 I literally can not memorize codes. What should I study exactly? Any recommendations about how to go about this class. Anything will help!!!!!", "comments": ["First, do not worry about where you are compared to others and do not worry too much about quizzes and the tests.  They aren\u2019t worth nearly as much as the projects.  Focus on the projects.  GO TO OFFICE HOURS.  Office hours will be a life saver, they are super helpful and it takes almost no time at all.  Make sure you have a partner for the projects.  I don\u2019t know how you can do the projects without a partner.\n\nSecond, you\u2019ll get better at the code with practice.  To study for the exam is to take the practice exams.  Starts doing the practice exams about two weeks before your exam, and keep running through it.  You\u2019ll eventually catch on to the patterns.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!", "I\u2019m in the class too. I have experience with programming but not python, so I was doing good so far but the difficulty is getting really up very quickly, I\u2019m even surprised. I\u2019m exchange student and happy to meet new people so if you want to help with basics we can study and work on project.", "The ULC has drop-in tutoring hours for CS 220 on Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 6-9pm on the 3rd floor of Wednt commons.
