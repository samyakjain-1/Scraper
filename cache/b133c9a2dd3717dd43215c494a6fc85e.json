{"title": "CS 537, CS 577 and CS 564", "body": "I am a senior CS student. And I am planning to take CS 537, CS 564 and CS 577 together for next semester. And I plan not to take any other courses. I am wondering if it is feasible.\n\nBy the way, 537 is taught by Barton Miller, 577 is taught by Dieter van melkebeek and 564 is taught by Paris Koutris. If I have to drop one, which one should I choose to drop?", "comments": ["Depends a lot on you.  It certainly wouldn't be impossible, those three classes would be a perfectly good first semester graduate student course load.\n\nIf you think you are probably in the top 20% of CS students for ability and work ethic, then that schedule may be challenging, but very livable.\n\nIf you've kinda been scraping by in the major, then that is probably too many classes that are both difficult and high effort.  You'll do poorly and/or completely melt down.", "[deleted]", "537 and 577 should be taken in separate semesters imo"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/gwvevz/cs_537_cs_577_and_cs_564/"}
