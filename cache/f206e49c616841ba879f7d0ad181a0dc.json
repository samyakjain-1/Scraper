I was curious to know:\n\n\\- How difficult are the projects?\n\n\\- How much time do you commit to projects? I know it's 4 credits which is a little daunting.\n\n\\- How was class been virtually?", "comments": ["CS 320 hasn't been too hard but, it is definitely a step up from 320. We were assigned groups at the start of the semester, it sounds like some groups are active and some are essentially dead. There are weekly quizzes that you can do as a group (pretty easy). The projects are due every 1-2 weeks. Similar to CS220 they provide a tester and you have 7 late days. It honestly doesn't feel like a 4 credit course so you should be fine."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/jt3wqj/cs_320/"}
