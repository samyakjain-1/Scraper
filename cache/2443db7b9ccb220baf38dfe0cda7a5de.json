I'm thinking about taking the class in fall so I'm interested in knowing the difficulty and what the typical coursework breakdown looks like :)\n\nThanks in advance!", "comments": ["One of the easiest upper level systems courses despite being 4 credits. It\u2019s pretty watered down", "I took it in the Fall and it wasn't bad at all. All of the assignments were done with a three-person group, so it's easy enough to split up the workload and make it incredibly manageable for a four-credit class. \n\nIf possible, **take the class with Anhai.** He is an amazing professor with some great advice for the real world."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1jf11gg/cs564_database_management_systems_design_and/"}
