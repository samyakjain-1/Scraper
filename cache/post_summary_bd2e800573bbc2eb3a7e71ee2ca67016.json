{"content": "Comparing Econ 101 and 102, students note that 101 has more algebra-based problems, while 102 is theory-based. Professor Gwen Eudey is highly recommended for 102, as she is said to make the material accessible and engaging. Students suggest that students should be prepared for the differences between the two courses and consider taking an early lecture to get a feel for Eudey's teaching style."}
