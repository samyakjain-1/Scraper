{"title": "Econ 102 Online - Spring", "body": "Who should I take Econ 102 online with? Looking for a professor who is best at explaining the concepts well? Can take with - Steven Rick, David Johnson, or Stella Chan.\n\nThanks in advance", "comments": ["Always David Johnson. Always.", "I\u2019ve always heard David Johnson is great, but I took Econ 102 this semester and I\u2019d also strongly advocate for Stella Chan. She\u2019s very good at explaining concepts, is well organized, has a ton of office hours before exams, and I think the class had been adapted pretty well to online. This is coming from someone who hated Econ 101 and is struggling with online classes a bit in general. There\u2019s also no Honorlock (we have open note/book exams) so that\u2019s pretty great.", "Johnson is entertaining and likes to curve. Steven Rick is pretty chill though"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/k6pgbw/econ_102_online_spring/"}
