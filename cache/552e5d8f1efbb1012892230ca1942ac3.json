{"title": "best courses to take with CS577?", "body": "Hi guys, I'm a CS major and making my degree planner.\n\nI've heard COMP SCI 577 is one of the toughest classes and most important class. So, I wanna focus on 577 more than other classes when I'm taking it but still need to take two more major courses with 577.\n\nAt this moment, I'm thinking about \n\nCOMP SCI 407 (Foundations of Mobile Systems and Applications ) and \n\nCOMP SCI 579 (Virtual Reality) to take with. Is that a doable plan? \n\nAnd how are the difficulty and workload COMP SCI 564 (Database Management)? Is it doable to take 564 instead of 579 in the plan above?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nNote: I'm an average student.", "comments": ["1. I don't think 407 is offered next semester, I could be wrong, and there's no info about when it will be offered again.\n\n2. 579 is pretty doable, you just need some progress every week and as long as you define a not too complicated project for yourself\n\n3. 564 is probably not a good idea to take with 577. The workload is not too insane but definitely not too chill either. Some people can do it but if you do this combo, then all of your other courses should be chill enough and you shouldn't be taking any other CS courses other than these.", "I would not do 564 with 577. 570 or 540 might be better options", "407 and 579 aren't offered next semester so you'll have to wait on those classes"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/u0ub6x/best_courses_to_take_with_cs577/"}
