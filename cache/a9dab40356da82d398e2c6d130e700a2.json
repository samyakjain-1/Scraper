It seems doable but difficult. \n\nI'm taking CS 544 this semester and it takes me about twice as long to do the projects as CS 320, if you've taken that. It's a lot of work but not too difficult- especially if you're taking 537/564 at the same time.", "Currently taking 537 and 544 at the same time and it\u2019s hard but not impossible. 544 has 8 programming assignments and take 4-10 hours each. 537 has 7 programming assignments and take 15+ hours each (this is just for me others may be faster). Expect to go to a lot of office hours to keep up.", "My brother is taking 564 and it\u2019s pretty difficult"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1boh9g5/cs_537_cs_544_and_cs_564639_thoughts/"}
