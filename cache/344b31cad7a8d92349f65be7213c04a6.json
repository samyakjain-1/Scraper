{"title": "CS540 - How firm are the Math Prerequisites?", "body": "I'm a working professional student that's been out of undergrad for 10 years.  This Summer I'm signed up for CS540 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) with Young Wu and I'm concerned about the math prerequisites.  \n\nI've never had to do math by hand once in the past decade.  While I'm willing to do some review on Paul's Notes and Khan Academy, I want to make sure I'm not biting off more than I can chew.  \n\nHow much math was required for this course and how hard was it?", "comments": ["The math involved was linear algebra and probabilities/statistics type stuff", "Took it this past semester, covers linear algebra (matrix multiplication, etc.), statistics, and logic/discrete math. The class slides cover the basics as a mind refresher for each topic. Not too bad imo.", "did you take the class last summer? was it online and were the exams proctored?"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/utfh5l/cs540_how_firm_are_the_math_prerequisites/"}
