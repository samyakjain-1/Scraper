{"title": "Math 222 in Summer? ", "body": "Has anyone taken Math 222 in the summer? How long does it last over the summer? Would working part time be manageable while taking this class? Difficulty? ", "comments": ["i took 222 over this last summer and ended with an A, my lecturer was Baihe (Danny) and he was amazing! He\u2019s usually the TA but taught the course during the summer. He didn\u2019t do anything electronically, instead opting to just write on the chalkboard. In this way, you would always be able to keep up pace with him as he wrote out every concept. He would also put up problems for you to solve during class, and thanks to the smaller class size, the TAs can help you when you get stuck. Our first midterm was really easy, a bit too easy, so they made the final exam harder. In the end, the grading scale got changed pretty drastically because of it! In the meantime, i worked a part time job yet found that i still had time to study and review. The course is only 8 weeks long though so you do need to be on top of your practice problems, but luckily due to the short class time, you don\u2019t cover all the topics in a standard semester, allowing you to focus on just a select few.", "I took Math 234 (calc 3) online over the Summer along with a part time and it worked out. I was spending about 20 to 30 hours a week on the class tho and less on the job.", "If you only need Math 222, Madison Area Technical College offers the equivalent course online"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gtsu3r/math_222_in_summer/"}
