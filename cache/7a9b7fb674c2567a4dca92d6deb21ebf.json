{"title": "Math 222 - No calculators???", "body": "I just went through the syllabus for Math 222 and it's written that no calculators are allowed for the exams? For anyone who has taken this class before with Lindsey - any insights into what to expect in the class regarding not getting to use calculators and just in general? For reference - I'm alright in math but it's not like I'm greatest in it.", "comments": ["I just took 222. There won't really be a need for a calculator. The \"numbers\" are usually either small roots or variables. I don't think I had to write out any problems on the side in exams to work out. The homework may require calculators but it should be pretty obvious when to use one. The content that you'd need a calculator to do (for example Euler's to approximate diff eqs or remainder theorem) won't show up on the tests.", "Took it last semester. Its a \"make them do the math class\" . You write out your equations and solve as much as you can, but for any big numbers they can deal with it. Honestly though, you shouldnt be getting any huge numbers. Basic 12x12 multiplication chart at most.", "You won\u2019t need it. Only thing you would need it for is basic math"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/10emn2s/math_222_no_calculators/"}
