Is Gwen Eudey better than Stella for 102?", "comments": ["101 has more algebra like problems while 102 is more theory based... Gwen is great for 102.... Both classes are about the same difficulty imo", "Gwen Eudey is a great professor. Highly recommend her, even if it means an early lecture. She makes it worth it.", "i did both this summer! had johnson for 101 and eudey for 102.\n\npersonally, i liked the formatting of eudey's class a lot more. as others are saying, it's a bit more humanities-esque based, which can be a pro/con depending on who u are. \n\nbut also, there are 2 midterms and she drops the lowest one, i got a 31/35 on the first this summer and a 29/35 with little studying (my friend did the same and she got a 32/35 on the first midterm this semester, so it's not just a summer school thing)."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/rajowq/econ_101_vs_102/"}
