Any opinions on CS 200 being hard for newer students? And how are the professors?\n", "comments": ["CS 200 is the introductory programming session for students. It should not be too hard, or you need to consider whether you should choose more programming courses. This course is about Java.\n\nCS 220 is Python, which may be easier. Both of them are introductory programming which do not need prior programming experience (it would be better if you know some)."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1ea0xjc/cs_200/"}
