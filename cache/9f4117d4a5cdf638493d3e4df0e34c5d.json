{"title": "Cs 320", "body": "I finished the Java sequence (200,300,400) but do not know any python :(. Do you guys think I can take CS 320 and skip CS 220 with my programming experience? How bad will it be. I think I can learn the basic syntax in 220 without actually taking it. Anyone have any advice or experience with my situation?", "comments": ["python syntax is relatively easy to pick up, especially if you have gone all the way through 400 with Java. I remember that the first project was a very simple intro to make sure everyone is up to speed with their python skills. 220 would be a waster of time for you as more than half the class just covers basic programming concepts.", "Yea syntax is really easy to pick up in general, don't overthink it, just write a few easy programs and you'll pick it up", "I took cs200, 300 and then skipped to cs320 without taking 220. \nAll I did was spend a bit of time over my winter break last year learning the syntax and it was completely fine when I took 320 last spring. I didn\u2019t feel that I missed anything crucial from 220. I think 220 pretty much explains concepts you\u2019ve already learned in 200,300,400 just in a different syntax but ideas are the same."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/ypwx0d/cs_320/"}
