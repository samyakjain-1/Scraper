{"title": "Math 222 - Math 340", "body": "Soo.. following the exam today I'm pretty sure I'm going to be around the D range. I'm just not sure if I should still continue to take Math 340 in the fall. I'm debating either retaking Math 222 or just going into 340. If I do end up taking 340 I'm planning to learn more about calc 2 through the summer but I'm not sure if that'd be enough. Is it possible to do good in math 340 while I barely got by in math 222?  \n\nI guess I'm just worried that I'll be set behind in courses- asking for advice on what to do and overall emotional support because coming in here with a 4.0 and math bombing my gpa doesn't feel too good lol.", "comments": ["Math department here (mostly calcs) will be the thing to lower your gpa. Promise it isn't just you, and to not take it personally. Go through with 340 and remember in the real world you get to have your notes, should you ever need to do integrals or derivatives in your field.\n\nEdit: For brushing up with calc 2 in the summer, watch The Organic Chemistry Tutor on youtube. Hands down some of the best calc videos, pretty short, and he makes things very simple and it helped me understand when my grades were down.", "Almost nothing from math 222 is used in math 340, except for like parametric equations and some of the vector stuff you learn at the end of math 222. I took math 340 this semester and found it way easier than calc 2. You just work on vectors and matrices the whole class. I personally don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be behind.", "I can\u2019t remember if I used any knowledge from 222 in 340. They minimally depend on each other. Although, I would brush up on your general ability to self study becquse you likely will have to do so in 340 as well"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/ulhoyt/math_222_math_340/"}
