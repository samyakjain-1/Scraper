{"title": "Passing grade for CS540?", "body": "It's been a tough semester dealing with some personal issues. Kind of behind in cs540 and was wondering what typically is a passing grade for it? ", "comments": ["Bro cs540 was hella drought this year.The midterm average was a 50%. The slide was unorganized kind of heard to get the main ideas. There is a lot of equation with a lot of variables but the teacher does not say what each of the variable in it means, so I have to ask ChatGPT on every equation. But regarding the grade I think you need to be top 95%, I don\u2019t think there any way to fail even if you fail all the test, while score at least then 50% on hw", "This semester is different as it is graded on a curve. See the grade prediction assignment in canvas. Top 80% passes iirc"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1hbeks9/passing_grade_for_cs540/"}
