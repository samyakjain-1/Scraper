{"title": "Renault CS 577 Grade Distribution", "body": "Does anyone know what a potential grade distribution could look like for CS 577 with Renault this semester? I have heard crazy things from Spring 2022 that a 65 overall translated to a BC, and a 71-75 was a B. How accurate is this? Our final exam is worth 45% of our grade and will be much harder than the quizzes we have had so far, so I am a little worried.", "comments": ["You may have already checked this, but here\u2019s historical letter grade shares for Prof. Renault\u2019s 577 classes: \nhttps://madgrades.com/courses/1f36cc02-0eee-3fcf-be09-1ad17aecf83c?termCode=0&instructorId=6043085\n\nIt could be useful to figure out roughly where you stand.", "I have heard that a major restructuring of the course has been in place for this semester so perhaps precedence won\u2019t be a strong factor.", "I took the class last Fall and yes, the curve was like what you are saying. It was very generous, but if there is any restructuring I'm not sure if it will continue to be like that. But if the class didn't really change grading wise up until now, I highly doubt that the curve would be much different this time too."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/zdcvh5/renault_cs_577_grade_distribution/"}
