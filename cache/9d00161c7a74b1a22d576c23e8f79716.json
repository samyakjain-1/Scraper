{"title": "CS 320 vs CS 300", "body": "Probably been asked here before but what\u2019s the big difference between these two classes? I know CS 300 is Java and 320 is Python but does CS 320 teach things like OOP and Data Structures similar to the 300/400 sequence just in Python? \n\nAlso which is more useful to take given an interest in attending grad school for Stat/Math/Comp Bio?\n\n\n", "comments": ["320 isn\u2019t structured for OOP stuff. Both great classes, but if you\u2019re looking for OOP, you\u2019ll want to take 300.\nI took both due to the requirement for 300 as an EE major and then 320 as a DS second major. \nStat/math -> 320 way more useful in my opinion"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1dbeob6/cs_320_vs_cs_300/"}
