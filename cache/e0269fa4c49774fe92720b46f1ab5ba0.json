I\u2019m planning on taking these classes and trying to figure out if the workload is doable.\n\nI haven\u2019t decided between CS 570 and CS 542 being my 4th class but I\u2019m pretty sure I will be taking atleast one of them along with CS 354, CS 320 and STAT 340.\n\nany advice is appreciated!", "comments": ["I\u2019m taking 354 and 320 right now. Here\u2019s what I can say:\n\n354: my class with the heaviest workload right now. You are responsible for a project every week, a homework (quiz like in 252) every week, shorter activities occasionally, and a lot of readings. So far it\u2019s a bit challenging because of the details of C but not terrible.\n\n320: also a heavy workload, but the grading is a bit more forgiving. There are long projects every couple of weeks, a lab, a quiz every week, and shorter readings. Also it could be my instructor but the instruction is kind of all over the place \n\nOverall this courseload seems like a decent amount but doable", "[deleted]", "kind of late, but CS320/STAT340 are more than doable together. i had tons of free time and didn't really have an issue taking them with a 4XX math class and a gened.i would guess that this schedule would be tough, but definitely doable."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/16tsueo/workload_of_cs_354_cs_320_stat_340_cs_570_cs_542/"}
