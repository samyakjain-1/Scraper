{"title": "CS 320 Summer Class 2024", "body": "For anyone enrolled in cs 320 for this summer: has anyone been enrolled in the canvas course or received an email from the instructor? The class starts next Monday and I haven\u2019t received any communication yet which makes me a bit nervous! I\u2019ve usually heard from profs by now regarding courses over the summer. Thanks ", "comments": ["Open canvas on a desktop, click courses on the left hand side, then all courses. Sometimes they don\u2019t pop up on your dashboard for whatever reason. If the class is listed under future enrollments (bottom of all courses list) it just means the professor hasn\u2019t published it - not an issue with you not being marked as an enrolled student. \n\nIf it isn\u2019t available on Monday, reach out to the department or the professor if there\u2019s one listed on CS&E. Enjoy your last free weekend!!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1dg6u66/cs_320_summer_class_2024/"}
