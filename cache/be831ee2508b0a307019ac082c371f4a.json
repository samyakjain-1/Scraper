How was it and how was exams / difficulties?", "comments": ["I wouldn't if you can avoid it, they'll have to shove the entirety of the course into a smaller amount of time.

Your interview coding assignments are going to be based on what you learned in algos.", "I took it with him last summer while taking two other classes also. Totally manageable but a lot of students felt the questions on the exam were often all or nothing. I didn't really feel that way but I got an AB. He does shittons of examples, and I personally really liked his teaching style.", "is 577 available over the summer? im not seeing it on the course enroll for the summer"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/109i7f3/cs_577_summer/"}
