I have Lindsay right now for 234 and she is awesome! Always very positive and seems to really care about the subject and she teaches very clearly. Would definitely recommend her if you can!", "Melissa Lindsey is quite organized and is an instructor rather than a professor. She is very good."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/z9wenc/best_prof_for_math_222/"}
