{"title": "questions about CS 200 course", "body": " I have no experience with coding, so I am taking CS 102 this semester and plan to take CS 200 next semester.\n\n If you have or already finished CS 200, could you tell me how difficult the class is or how difficult it is to get an A?\n\n For next semester, Professor Jim Williams will be teaching this course. In this case, do you recommend online or in-person classes?", "comments": ["I used to TA for CS 200. It depends. A lot of students struggled while others breezed through it. Either way, the class is quite a lot of work, but it's relatively easy to get an A as long as you do the work and are willing to get help when you don't understand something. They have a lot of office hours so help is always available. If you do take it, go to office hours as soon as you don't understand a concept because the class will continue to build on them instead of just moving to the next thing.", "For those totally new to programming, it is a time consuming course. You are going to need to spend at least 7 - 10 hours per week working on your small assignments outside class. (If you are a math or engineering whiz, maybe less time) \n\nIn my opinion, the class is hard work, but well worth it. \n\nA lot of the assignments you do are online, so I think it is best to take the class In-Person. \n\nWilliams is a good lecturer, he makes very important points during the one lecture day. It\u2019s important to be there and be engaged.", "I started in 300 so I can't speak on 200's difficulty but I'd highly suggest watching thenewboston's introduction to Java playlist on YouTube, especially if you're totally new to programming. Having any amount of programming knowledge going in will help significantly."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/17dndju/questions_about_cs_200_course/"}
