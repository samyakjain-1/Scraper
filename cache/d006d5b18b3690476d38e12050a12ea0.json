{"title": "Graduating without taking CS 537 (Introduction to Operating Systems)", "body": "I am planning on graduating this fall, taking CS 542, CS 570, one breadth requirement class, and CS 537 in my final semester. I understand that CS 537 is a \"must take\" for CS majors, and I am not disinterested in the topics the course explores.\n\nIt feels risky to take such a difficult course in my final semester, so I am considering swapping it for CS 506. Would I be doing myself a disservice by not taking OS during my college career? \n\nThanks in advance.", "comments": ["\"The\" textbook for OS was written by faculty here at UW-Madison. I won't take the class because I'm not a CS major but just take that into consideration.", "I'm in the class now so I can talk a bit about the workload. The projects have a fairly reasonable coding amount but they will still take me days of \"coding\" (I'm blankly staring at a screen a lot or rereading the instructions). TA office hours will help so much, for most projects as they will help you visualize what you're supposed to do. I'm just taking OS with math 240 so if you just have cs 537 I think you should be fine. The midterms for OS aren't bad at all, around a B average because they give so many practice ones so you know what to expect. This is all said by someone who literally failed the first project and didn't drop and now has a B.", "How have you done overall in the major? It\u2019s really, really hard to actually fail OS as long as you submit everything and don\u2019t cheat."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1c13j28/graduating_without_taking_cs_537_introduction_to/"}
