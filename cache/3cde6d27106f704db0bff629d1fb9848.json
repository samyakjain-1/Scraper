If it\u2019s just some basics I\u2019m sure I can pick them up no problem", "comments": ["Barely any. Just the most basic foundations like supply/demand and competitions and stuff. The stuff that does come up you can just search it up quickly to remind yourself. You'll be fine.", "I\u2019m also taking the course too this semester! I took both AP micro and AP macro in high school and there wasn\u2019t many similarities between the courses, maybe some supply and demand review but it\u2019s very easy to grasp. I much preferred macro and found it a lot easier than micro.", "If ur not an econ major just take the course online through UW Independent Learning. It'll be much easier and more straight forward"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1ezmql3/econ_102_macroeconomics_how_much_microeconomics/"}
