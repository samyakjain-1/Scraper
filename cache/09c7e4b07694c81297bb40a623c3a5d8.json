{"title": "CS 220 as a CS major?", "body": "Need some extra random credits and a GPA booster. Figured this would be a good way to do it while simultaneously learning python. Is it an easy A for a Junior in CS? Or is it like learning a completely new subject? I got an A in 200, AB in 300, and B in 400. I also recall spending a lottt of time on 200, so I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ll still have to spend that kind of time in 220. I don\u2019t want it to take much time away from me studying for OS.", "comments": ["Easy A", "Python is simple you\u2019re chillin. They didn\u2019t let you skip to 320 when I took it and I skipped every lecture and still got a high A"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/17yfbdz/cs_220_as_a_cs_major/"}
