{"title": "Math 222 and Preps", "body": "I\u2019ve been told by some juniors and seniors that math 222 builds off 221, and I should take Preps for it b/c of my AP credit from AB. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t fit in my schedule. What content am I missing with just my AP Calc AB credit instead of taking 221. \n\nTLDR: what content is missing from the AP Calc AB credit that\u2019s taught in 221 and used in 222", "comments": ["Personally (straight to 222 but helped people with 221), there was only one unit my AP calc AB didn\u2019t cover. If I remember correctly it was implicit differentiation? But it was a minimal amount of catch-up work. I did have a better professor than most (Erman) so he might deserve most of the credit lol\n\nI think if you\u2019re comfortable with your AB calc knowledge, there\u2019s no need to take 221. But it\u2019s probably a good idea to get a hold of the syllabus (or even a textbook/packet, you can see previous editions online) and see if everything looks familiar."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1f83vys/math_222_and_preps/"}
