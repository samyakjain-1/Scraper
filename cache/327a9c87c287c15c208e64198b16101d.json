My prof also recommended watching the MIT algos lectures on YouTube, which generally covers the same topics, but in my class we followed the text much more closely and the videos not so much.", "I just finished the class with Dieter, the textbook he referred to very occasionally  is available online for free here\nhttp://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/\n\nYou will get scribe notes for all of the topics which are essentially Dieter's own textbook, the man is a master of the subject and frankly I never used anything other than those."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/keyv19/cs_577_textbooks/"}
