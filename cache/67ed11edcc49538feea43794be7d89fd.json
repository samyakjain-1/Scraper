{"title": "CS 220 Curve", "body": "So basically I did bad on the final, and am now sitting at a 94.2 in the class. The syllabus says only 95% guarantees an A, and that there may be a curve later. Does anyone know what this curve usually is? I am just so annoyed and paranoid that I now won\u2019t get an A in the class. Thank you", "comments": ["There was no curve last semester besides the extra credit quiz. I got a 94.5 and ended with an AB", "It was a 95 last semester, no rounding", "Email Meena shes super accommodating and if you have done really well on all the projects she might work with you. You could email Tyler or Kuemmel too."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/n3isr5/cs_220_curve/"}
