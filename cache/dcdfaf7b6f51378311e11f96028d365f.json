{"title": "Should I take CS 220 for Data science when I\u2019ve already taken CS 200?", "body": "So I was debating between the CS major and the DS major. Initially I went through with taking cs 200, but now I\u2019m debating if I actually need cs 220 for the Data science Major. Would it be a waste of time to take cs 220? I was planning on maybe taking cs 220 and cs 300 next semester. Would that be too much of a workload? Especially with learning python and continuing with Java at the same time?", "comments": ["I think if you do CS 200 or 300 (I forget exactly), then you should be able to do CS 320 without needing to do 220. This is probably a good idea to consider to save time and make it easier to fit in required courses.", "If you don't need to take it for major requirements then I would hold off. It will be very redundant. The only things I can think of that would maybe be emphasized more in an intro Programming for Data Science class would be pandas and data scrubbing. If you don't know any pandas I would just catch up by yourself. The documentation is awesome and easy to understand.", "talk to your advisor but if u do 200 300 then u can take 368 which is a one credit course that teaches u the python syntax based on ur java knowledge u did in 200 300\n\nso basically after 300 u know what classes are and methods are and u dont need to take python courses to learn the same thing, what 368 will do is teach u how to write classes n methods in python, the logic is the same\n\nplus no attendance required and its pass fail so if u do well throughout then no finals"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/180rjcc/should_i_take_cs_220_for_data_science_when_ive/"}
