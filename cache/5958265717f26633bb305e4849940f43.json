How challenging is econ 102?", "comments": ["To be honest, it seems like econ 102 material is easier than 101. But again it depends whether you like macro or microeconomics. Try to take it with Chan because her transition to online was fantastic and I honestly stopped reading the textbooks after 1st exam and just watched the lectures. Anyways, if you found 101 interesting and not extremely challenging, I am sure that you will love 102 as well", "Most people here found 102 easier. Personally, I found it harder, but that could also be because I spent much less time on it. I found Econ 101 much easier, but I found both clases very interesting and relatively simple. \n\nFor context I got an AB on both classes."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/kivz42/difficulty_of_econ_102/"}
