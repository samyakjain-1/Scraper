{"title": "CS577 Advice", "body": "I will be taking CS577 next semester with Marc Renault. Any advice on how to prepare for the course? Thank you.", "comments": ["Don\u2019t prep for algos- instead, learn as much as you can in your other classes ahead of time and save algos for the present\n\nThis will allow you to dedicate more time to algos when you need it, during the course. Yes, algos is time consuming, but learning it before the course will hardly help you as far as the time taken on each individual homework assignment", "Make sure you understand proof by induction.", "Honestly I didn\u2019t really think 577 was all that difficult, especially Renault\u2019s section. The curve at the end of the semester was pretty generous and all the HW problems have solutions online if you know where to look. He teaches it well enough in my opinion that if you go to lecture and do each HW, you will be set (at least I was). The biweekly quizzes should tell you how well you understand each topic. The Kleinberg and Tardos textbook follows the class directly and even goes in to more detail if you are curious."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/rpfmjn/cs577_advice/"}
