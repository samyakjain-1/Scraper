{"title": "CS 320 with no Python experience?", "body": "Hi I am deciding on what classes to take next semester. I have taken cs300 and next semester I plan on taking CS400 along with discrete math and 1 breadth class. I am also considering a certificate in data science but idk if I should start with 220 or go straight to 320 since I've taken 300 already. I have almost no python experience. Any advice would be greatly appreciated", "comments": ["If you already took CS 300, I'd say go into 320. the first project of CS 320 is reviewing python basics. I went from 320 to 300 with no Java experience, which was intimidating at first, but after the first project, my lack of previous experience didn't feel like that big of a deal. I feel like 300 to 320 would be similar to my case.\n\nBUT... if you wanted to fulfill the data science certificate easily (less difficult classes) you could start at CS 220 and take CS 320 after to get 2 out of the 5 classes needed for the certificate out of the way.", "I think that you could honestly choose either, 220 might be a bit easy but will help you get that solid python foundation, and 320 might be a bit fast but it will teach you a ton of really cool stuff", "depends what u wanna do. If you want a structured class go with 220. Otherwise you can easily teach yourself the material from YouTube or a beginner textbook"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/z18454/cs_320_with_no_python_experience/"}
