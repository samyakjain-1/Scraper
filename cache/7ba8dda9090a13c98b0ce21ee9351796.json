{"title": "CS 320", "body": "Hi everyone, I plan to take CS320 next semester, and it seems that Meena is the only one teaching the course. So I want to ask:\n- How heavy is the course in general?\n- I didn\u2019t take CS220 but I have some Python DS experience (know a little little bit about numpy matplotlib and stuff) and I will have completed CS300 this fall, so will I have any trouble if I take the course?\n- How is the professor in general? There\u2019s not much info abt them teaching in 320, and 220 is kinda mixed.", "comments": [" I took cs 220 with meena, and cs320 with Tyler. \nThere are weekly quizzes, and there are 7 projects throughout the semester. \nThe projects involved selenium, matplotlib, flask, numpy, etc so I think you\u2019ll be good for the projects. I found them time consuming so my advice start early on the projects. \nAs for meena I really liked her teaching in cs220."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/ygc4au/cs_320/"}
