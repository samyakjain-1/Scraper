Heard the same with CS537. I think if you have the motivation to apply yourself beyond minimum homework requirements you'll survive that load. Still won't be fun", "Imo 340 isn\u2019t too bad. Just have to keep up with the work. I would recommend watching 3blue1brown linear algebra videos to help with understanding the content. It is incredibly easy to understand the concepts after watching his videos."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/u232no/cs537_math_340_and_stat_240/"}
