Btw, im doing 354 and 577 rn, which is a lot of work, but manageable so I wanted to know if this would be similar or more in terms of workload. And if it is too much, which is better to take with OS, 540 or 571?\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;", "comments": ["Definitely wouldn't do that. You get weekly projects from both 540 + 571 and both can be time consuming. I haven't taken 537 yet, but my roommate who easily aced 354 (by easily I mean never seen him put much effort on this course yet got 100 on 2 midterms) last semester is now struggling a lot with the projects on 537 this semester. So I wouldn't imagine myself doing this. From my perspective 540 and 571 have very similar workload and course structure. So it really depends on what content you are more interested or which section you can get in"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1c1oe9c/cs_537540571/"}
