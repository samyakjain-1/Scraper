I did this (just not during the summer), and I did struggle on the first project because it is a new language, but it was very beginner friendly to help with the transition. the profs also understand that many students also come from non-java courses and will give pointers in lecture.", "Who\u2019s your professor?"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/144p2g7/cs_300_after_taking_cs_220_320/"}
