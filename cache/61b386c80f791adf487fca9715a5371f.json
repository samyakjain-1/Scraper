Is this worth it? Also is CS 200 a difficult or time-consuming class?", "comments": ["You definitely don\u2019t need to take CS 200 before 220. 220 is an introductory course so they assume you know nothing. \n\nThe 200/300/400 sequence and the 220/320 sequence focus on different things/languages so if you\u2019re not a CS major I\u2019d pick one path instead of both.", "Im pretty sure they cover two different programming languages (java vs python), but if you have no coding experience, I think taking CS 200 would be beneficial.", "CS200 is VERY time consuming.  When I took it, there was an assignment due almost every day, and when you have other stuff going on, it's easy to lose track.\n\nIf I remember, there was something like Participation Activity, Challenge Activity, Group Lab, zyLab, and something else every week.  And then of course frequent tests.\n\nEspecially if you don't know programming, it is time consuming, but even if you do, it's not like you can speed up Group Lab."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/u5xlta/cs_200_before_cs_220/"}
