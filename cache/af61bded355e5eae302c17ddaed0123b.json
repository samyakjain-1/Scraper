If that is something you are interested in, you should take it.", "I\u2019m assuming you are already enrolled in all of them since they are probably already full by now. Which professors did you enroll with?"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1cqrvpu/cs_354_or_cs_525_or_cs_540_over_summer/"}
