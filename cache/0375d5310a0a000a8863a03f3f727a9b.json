{"title": "Textbooks and CS 200", "body": "1. Do y\u2019all recommend getting the books as soon as the book list is posted by the professor or should I wait for classes to get started? And why?\n\n2. I wanna do a minor in CS, is CS 200 a good class for someone who has little to nothing experience in coding? If not which other class is a good class for a beginner? ", "comments": ["Note: I took CS 300, but the class structures are similar.\n1. I believe you use Zybooks for CS 200, which is an interactive textbook that you use for completion grade type activities and turning in labs. I would wait until the first day to get the information to buy the Zybook because you most likely have to enter a class code when you buy it.\n2. Yes. If you have no/little coding experience, CS 200 is where you should start out. Many core CS courses require at least CS 200 or CS 300 as a prerequisite.\n\nI hope this is helpful. If you have any more questions about CS in general I can try to answer them as well. :)"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/9bbtoo/textbooks_and_cs_200/"}
