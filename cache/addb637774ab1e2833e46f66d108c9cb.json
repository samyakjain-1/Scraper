{"title": "CS 537 + 2 more", "body": "I am currently enrolled in CS 537, 540, 544, and 571. Im definitely taking OS (537). I wanted to know what would be the easiest combination (taking 2 of the other 3) and save the last one for next semester. Thanks", "comments": ["I heard intro to AI is just all Wikipedia shit lol. The other two classes seem more useful", "Im in a very similar situation as you just 1 semester ahead lol. Currently enrolled in 544, 537 and another CS class, and planning on taking 571 over the summer. I think the hardest class in this group would be 537, then 544, then 540. I haven\u2019t taken 571 but I\u2019ve heard its not too easy so maybe somewhere before or after 544. Seriously consider any way you can avoid this schedule because no matter how you cut it you\u2019re gonna be doing 7 programming assignments in 537, 8 in 544 and I think at least 10 or something in 540\u2026 on the other hand, 537 and 544 have some overlapping material (locks and file systems) and 544 and 540 have some overlapping material (both are in python, some machine learning stuff in both), so I think the combo of 537 544 and 540 will at least let you have a slightly easier time studying these things. Good luck!"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1c2l2qu/cs_537_2_more/"}
