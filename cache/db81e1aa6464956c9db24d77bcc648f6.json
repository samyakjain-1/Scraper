{"title": "CS 577 and 354 together", "body": "I'm going to be taking both 577 and 354 this spring (I'm a sophomore). I'll probably end up taking only 12/13 credits anyway. Anyone have any experience with both these classes together? Manageable?", "comments": ["Good luck dawg you're in for one hell of a semester, unless you're just aiming for a passing grade", "354 is taught pretty well in an online format until the very end. Just keep up with the lectures (don\u2019t fall 2 weeks behind) and you should do pretty well.", "Algorithms is a really demanding course, you're going to have to put in the time to get an A, the weekly assignments taking 10 hours to fully understand and do properly is normal. CS 354 is just a shitty slog at times and sucks up your time more than it feels like it should, although the profs for the course next semester are both good. I'd personally recommend \nMichael Doescher but you can't go wrong with Deb Deppeler either. It'll be a decent amount of work but if you're disciplined and really only taking 12 credits it'll be fine."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/kh5lq4/cs_577_and_354_together/"}
