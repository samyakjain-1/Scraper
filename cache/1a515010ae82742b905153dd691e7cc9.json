I'd recommend taking an online course on React during winter break before you begin taking 571 as it will give you a huge leg up. In lectures the fundamentals are covered,  but you really need to practice more than just the fundamentals in the projects. I had previous experience with React and the weekly projects still take me anywhere from 5-12 hours to finish. That being said, if you're just taking these two CS classes then it's pretty easily doable.", "Anyone knows 200-300 level course which is about SQL/Database ?"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/qveu9i/cs_564/"}
