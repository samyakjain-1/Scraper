How valuable is it?", "body": "Hi, I\u2019m going to be a senior next fall and I wanted to hear people\u2019s opinions on CS537, Operating Systems, and why it\u2019s a good class. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s a lot of work, so is it worth the pain? \n\nThanks!", "comments": ["I took 537 a few years back with a new professor using Remzi\u2019s book, was hard and made me sad, and don\u2019t directly use it in the field, but looking back it was an interesting course and the topics addresses are good for software development. But I guess it really depends what your future plans are (CS/software dev/embedded engineer/etc) (I just do stuff on the back end in Java)", "I'll date myself as I graduated in 2012 and have been in the programming field for 10 years now. I thought CS537 was interesting and you learn some cool stuff but I regretted not taking CS564 Database Management Systems as I realized that was much more practical for standard work in the field. Can't go wrong either way, just my two cents if you haven't taken the other!", "I would say it should be required. I took it with Remzi and it really wasn't that hard. Plus it's basically the only course that teaches you about threading, how to implement it, and how to use it."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/ty1isp/cs_537_operating_systems_is_it_worth_it_how/"}
