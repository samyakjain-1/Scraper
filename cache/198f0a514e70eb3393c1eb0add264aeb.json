{"title": "Tips for ECON 102 with Gwen?", "body": "Hey so kinda like the title!! I have found macroeconomics to be much more digestible than micro, but I just bombed the first midterm and was wondering if anyone had any tips! I don\u2019t completely know why I did so bad as I always attend lecture, take notes, and study but I scored the lowest I think in the class (according to canvas). I\u2019m honestly bummed but I know we get a midterm dropped so I\u2019m really hoping (and needing) things to go better for the second\ud83e\udd1e. Thanks in advance!", "comments": ["she posts old exams. i studied those religiously and there were lots of duplicate questions! LMK if you need those. I took her class a few years ago but the canvas page and old exams are still posted."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/szxait/tips_for_econ_102_with_gwen/"}
