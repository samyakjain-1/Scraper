Is there somewhere I can find one?", "comments": ["You could always email the primary CS200 instructor (Jim Williams) for a topics list, though I'm not sure whether he's checking his email this summer or not.\n\nThe first program in CS300 is mostly a review of \"stuff you should have learned in your previous programming class\", things like writing static methods, using loops and conditionals, variables, arrays, that kind of thing. A lot of people have said they think it's the hardest program in the class, mostly because you're getting back up to speed after not having programmed in \\[however long\\], so honestly if you can just keep low-key practicing Java programming over the summer you'll have a leg up.\n\nAdditionally, I'm working on a 5-week supplementary 1-credit lab that'll go alongside the beginning of CS300 and give you some extra Java practice. It's aimed at people coming from Python or other programming languages, but if you just want the additional Java refresher that's also an option. (Dunno when that's going live for registration, though, or if it has already)", "UW gives credit for a 4 or a 5 on an APCSA score and I remember seeing on their website somewhere that the topics of APCSA line up pretty well with those of CS200. I think, then, that you could check out APCSA's syllabus.", "You could always try the [peg solitaire](https://cs300-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/peg-solitaire/) self assessment."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/vue2bu/cs_200_syllabus/"}
