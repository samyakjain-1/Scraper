What your thoughts about taking this class with him ?\n\nThe only information I have about 564 is to avoid the course like the plague if Ambuj Shatdal is teaching it", "comments": ["Eh, I took it with Ambuj Shatdal and it was ok. The assignments and tests were weird, but I felt like he presented the material pretty well and fully, I learned a lot in his class.  Paris Kotrius is a great instructor, I have heard he teaches the class well.", "Worst CS course I took. Started going to the other lecture at a different time because they were just better.\n\nMaybe give him the benefit of the doubt a bit if you want. That was his first semester teaching. But he did have a bit of a stick up his ass about curving the course after the average on the first exam was in the low 40s or 30s iirc. Which, to be clear, was a hard as fuck exam. The highest score was a 90% from a grad student. I didn't talk to anyone that did better than 60."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/djsgsx/cs564/"}
