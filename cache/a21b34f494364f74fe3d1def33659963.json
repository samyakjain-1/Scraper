{"title": "CS 220", "body": "I've already taken CS 200, 300, and 400, and so I feel very confident about Java. Should I take CS 220? Its a 4 credit class and is really limiting to my schedule this semester, but I also would like to learn Python. Given my Java knowledge, would it be easy enough to learn Python on my own or would the class be worth it?", "comments": ["Much better to learn on your own.", "it should be easy enough to do on your own. i had to self teach when i took ai (had same prior experience as you) and i had it down by the time i finished the first project. the languages are not super different", "Python is far easier than Java to learn. The class is also a really great experience tho, just keep in mind that there are quite a few projects so you may not want to take it with other time intensive courses."], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/rqv0xq/cs_220/"}
