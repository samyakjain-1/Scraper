Can I attend the in-person classes without asking anyone or should I email the professor about it?\n\nThanks.", "comments": ["Nothing is stopping you from going anyways really. The only real concern is if the lecture hall is already full. Also if its a different professor they may cover slightly different material to your professor (I doubt that would be the case for an intro class however)", "Lecture is NOT worth it. Prof. Williams literally said himself its just a discussion. We still have to watch the same videos as y'all do online. I'm seriously just letting you know right now you're on a better boat. I use lecture as a place to just bang out zybooks lol. I heard its the same for Renault too, although I'm not sure if he has inperson this sem?"], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/pkmsgw/cs_200_inperson_instead_of_online_classes/"}
